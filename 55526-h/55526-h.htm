<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Law of the Bolo, which runs throughout the
Philippine Islands, has the crowning merit of simplicity. Unlike the
codes of other countries, with their folios of verbiage, their
precedents, decisions, and interpretations, their hair-splitting
subtleties and refinements of phrase, their hidden dangers for the
unwary and unfortunate, the Law of the Bolo, of the terrible
two-foot-long knife, with which a Filipino can cleave his enemy from
collar-bone to the waist, has but one clause&mdash;that the spoil shall
go to the man with the longest reach. Possibly the process is crude,
but, at least, it is speedy and final. Judge, jury, counsel, the Bolo
takes the place of all these; and there is no appeal, at any rate in
this life.</p>
<p>The Law of the Bolo has also the merit of antiquity. It was in force
when the Spaniards annexed the Archipelago; it is in force there
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e253" href="#xd25e253" name=
"xd25e253">viii</a>]</span>to-day, under the American successors of the
Spaniards; and probably it will still be in force when, not only this
generation, but half a dozen of its successors as well, have passed
away&mdash;not because it is perfect, no law is, but because it is so
admirably suited to local conditions.</p>
<p>Half the troubles in the Islands during the last century or
so&mdash;a great many more than half, probably&mdash;have been due to
the fact that white men would not recognise this elemental code. Mr
Commissioner Furber, the head of the department of Constabulary and
Trade in Manila, regarded it as scandalous, as did also Mr Dwight P.
Sharler, the Chief Collector of Customs, and Mr Joseph Gobbitt, of the
British firm of Gobbitt &amp; Dunk, Eastern merchants; but both old
Felizardo, the ladrone leader, and Captain Basil Hayle of the
Philippines Constabulary, understood it, and acted on that knowledge,
thereby avoiding many mistakes, as this story will show&#8202;&hellip;.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2 class="main">HOW FELIZARDO TOOK TO THE HILLS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Felizardo was sixty years of age, a wizened little
man, quiet of voice, emphatic of gesture, when the Americans displaced
the Spaniards, and began to preach the doctrines of Law and Order,
coupled with those of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, as defined by
the Declaration of Independence. In appearance, Felizardo was not
unlike a Japanese, being purely Asiatic by descent; but, so far as
essential characteristics, were concerned, he was a son of the Tropics,
with the qualities of his kind.</p>
<p>For all practical purposes, Felizardo&rsquo;s history begins
thirty-five years before the coming of the Americans. Up till that
point in his career, he had been an ordinary tao, one of the peasantry
of a village some ten miles from Manila, outwardly apathetic and
inoffensive, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>respecting, or at least fearing, the Law as
represented by the Presidente and the Guardia <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e272" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span>, and earning such money
as he needed&mdash;which was not much&mdash;by an occasional
day&rsquo;s work in his hemp-patch up on the mountain-side. For the
rest, he fished when he had sufficient energy, or was sufficiently
hungry so to do, or gathered cocoa-nuts in the grove which stretched
for a couple of miles along the sea-shore. Then, suddenly, Dolores
Lasara came into his life, and his character developed.</p>
<p>Dolores was the daughter of Juan Lasara, the Teniente of San
Polycarpio, the next village to that in which Felizardo had been born
and bred. Rumour in the village, which possibly spoke the truth,
declared that Juan was connected with the local band of ladrones, and,
as that body enjoyed a degree of immunity unusual even in the
Philippines, there may have been grounds for the suspicion.</p>
<p>Juan Lasara was a mestizo, a half-caste, and Dolores herself showed
strong traces of her white ancestry. Felizardo, on the other hand, was
a native pure and simple, and, unlike most of his kind, prided himself
on the fact.</p>
<p>Dolores and Felizardo first met after a <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e281" title="Source: festa">fiesta</span>, the feast of the patron
saint of San Polycarpio. The girl, clad all in white, was walking in
the procession round the plaza, following closely in the wake of the
stout priest and the gaudily-painted image, when the man, lounging
against <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>the timbers of the crude belfry, smoking the eternal
cigarette, suddenly awakened to the fact that there were other things
in life besides tobacco and native spirits and game-cocks. He did not
follow Dolores into the church&mdash;that would have involved
abstention from several cigarettes, and would, to his mind, have served
no useful purpose&mdash;but he waited outside patiently, and, when she
emerged, followed her home, where he made the acquaintance of her
father, whom he knew well by sight.</p>
<p>Juan Lasara, the Teniente of San Polycarpio, was a very able man, as
his hidden store of greasy Bank of Spain notes would have told you, if
you had been able to unearth them from the hiding-place up on the
mountain-side; and, being able, he realised that there were latent
possibilities in the rather shy young tao who was so obviously taken
with Dolores; consequently, he was perfectly ready to let the girl
accompany Felizardo down to the cockpit to see the fights, which, as
every Filipino knows, are the most important part of a religious
festival.</p>
<p>The Teniente saw the young people off from the veranda of his house,
the only stone-built one in San Polycarpio; then he went back to his
office, where presently there came to him Father Pablo, the parish
priest, also a mestizo, and Cinicio Dagujob, a fierce little man, with
two bolos strapped on his waist. The last-named had come in,
unostentatiously, from the jungle <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4"
href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>behind the house, after the two
Guardia <span class="corr" id="xd25e292" title=
"Source: Civile">Civil</span>, who had been sent to attend the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e295" title="Source: festa">fiesta</span>,
had gone off to keep order at the cockpit; and even now he did not seem
quite at ease, knowing that those dreaded Spanish <i>gens
d&rsquo;armes</i> were still in the village. &ldquo;There might be
trouble at the cockpit, and they might bring their prisoners
here,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Juan Lasara laughed. &ldquo;If there were trouble, they would only
beat the causes of it with the flat of their sabres. That is their
way&mdash;with the tao. It is only you and your kind that they take as
prisoners, or kill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cinicio&rsquo;s beady eyes flashed. &ldquo;And how about you and the
reverend father?&rdquo; he snarled.</p>
<p>Once more Lasara laughed. &ldquo;He is the priest of San Polycarpio,
and I am the Teniente. If they came&mdash;which they would not do
without warning&mdash;you would be Dagujob, the ladrone chief, whom we
had lured here, in order that he might be taken and hanged on the new
gallows at Calocan. You understand, Cinicio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden movement of his hand to his side showed that the robber did
comprehend; then the half-drawn bolo was thrust back into its wooden
sheath, contemptuously. &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; its owner growled,
&ldquo;you dare not. I should talk, and there is room on that gallows
for three of us, even when one is a fat priest. And now&mdash;what is
the business we are to discuss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Pablo blew out a cloud of smoke <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>and watched it curling
upwards. &ldquo;Don Jos&eacute; Ramirez will be receiving three
thousand pesos next month to pay for the new hemp land he is buying
from the Friars,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Cinicio Dagujob leaned forward. &ldquo;Don Jos&eacute;, the Spanish
merchant at Calocan?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The priest nodded, whilst the Teniente added with a grin: &ldquo;His
place is opposite the new gallows, which they have put up for you and
your kind, Cinicio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladrone ignored the last remark; this was now a purely
professional matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we to get in?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;The house is
of stone, well shuttered; and, if we tried force, the noise would bring
down the Guardia <span class="corr" id="xd25e322" title=
"Source: Civile">Civil</span>, who are only a quarter of a mile
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Pablo had gone to the window, and was staring out. He
preferred not to listen to such discussions, which accorded ill with
his calling; but the Teniente had no such scruples. &ldquo;You must
have some one inside, to open the door, then when Don Jos&eacute; comes
down&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He finished with a suggestive motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easy to say,&rdquo; growled the
ladrone&mdash;&ldquo;very easy to say; but whom can you get? Our own
men are&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders
expressively&mdash;&ldquo;suspected; and they might not like to be so
near your gallows; whilst your people here are fools, every
one&mdash;just common tao. Then a man from Manila would get in one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>of his own hands. It is rubbish. I know Don
Jos&eacute; Ramirez of old. He will keep his pesos safe until he hands
them over to the Friars; and then, of course, one cannot rob the
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Pablo, standing with his back to them, seemed to have missed
everything else, but he heard those last words, and nodded his head,
apparently in approval of the sentiment; though possibly, could the
others have seen it, the smile on his face might have explained various
things to them.</p>
<p>The Teniente of San Polycarpio did not answer at once, but lighted a
fresh cigar very carefully, and got it drawing well; then, &ldquo;I
have the man,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;He came to me to-day, by
chance, following my daughter, Dolores.&rdquo; Father Pablo started
slightly. &ldquo;He is a tao, with brains. I know Don Jos&eacute; wants
a man to live in the house. If I send this young Felizardo to him, he
will take him; and if I promise Felizardo that he shall marry Dolores,
the door will be opened to you. I only met him to-day,
but&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed pleasantly&mdash;&ldquo;I know men and
women; and I saw how it was with those two, at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no smile on Father Pablo&rsquo;s face now, and one of his
hands was gripping the window frame more tightly than a casual observer
might have thought necessary; but the two other men were not watching
him, being interested in the details of their plan. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was sundown when Felizardo and Dolores came back, chattering
gaily. On the road they passed the two Guardia <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e341" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span>, in their gorgeous
uniforms, with their clattering sabres and horse pistols in vast
leather holsters. Felizardo received a friendly nod from them, being
known as a decent young tao; but Father Pablo, whom they met a little
further on, had no blessing to bestow, only a scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like him,&rdquo; the man said abruptly.</p>
<p>The girl shivered slightly. &ldquo;Nor I. He is a priest, I know;
but still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off significantly, and, for
the first time in his life, Felizardo felt the instinct to kill awaken
in him. Unconsciously, he became a convert to the Law of the Bolo;
consciously, he decided that Father Pablo must be watched.</p>
<p>The Teniente of San Polycarpio was alone when the couple returned,
and received Felizardo very graciously. He was interested in the young
man, and asked him many questions, whilst Dolores was preparing some
supper, a far more elaborate supper than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to do better,&rdquo; Lasara said kindly. &ldquo;I
see you are not like the majority; and there are careers for those who
are ready to work. Look at myself&rdquo;&mdash;he was a
hemp-buyer&mdash;&ldquo;I started to learn in a Spaniard&rsquo;s store,
and made all this myself. I should be a very happy man, if only I had a
son. As it is, there is Dolores alone; and my ambition now is to see
her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>married to an honourable man, a man of the people
like myself, not a frothy agitator from Manila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Felizardo fumbled badly with the cigarette he was rolling; but
before he could make any reply, his host had got up abruptly.
&ldquo;Come and see me again soon&mdash;the day after to-morrow, if you
like. I believe I know of a post which might suit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They make love quickly in the Tropics; consequently, it was not out
of the natural order of things that, as he walked home through the
cocoa-nut groves that night, Felizardo should feel sure both of his own
feelings and of those of Dolores. Somehow, the world seemed to have
grown a very different place. He had never noticed the moon quite so
bright before, never realised how wonderfully beautiful was the effect
of the light dancing on the waters. Then, suddenly, with a sense of
shame, he remembered how he had wasted his life. He had eaten, smoked,
and gambled on fighting-cocks&mdash;that was his whole record so far;
but it should be different for the future. He turned into his little
nipa-thatched house full of this good resolution, and awakened in the
morning still of the same mind. There was a <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e358" title="Source: festa">fiesta</span> on in his own village
that day, and he had saved five pesos in order to have an unusually
large bet on his own favourite fighting-cock, hitherto the champion of
the place; but, instead of doing so, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9"
href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>he donned his working clothes, took
his working bolo, and started off towards his hemp-patch, two miles
away, up the hillside. One or two women he passed&mdash;the men rose
late on <span class="corr" id="xd25e363" title=
"Source: festa-days">fiesta-days</span>&mdash;stared after him in
astonishment; whilst a youth, who was taking a game-cock for its
morning airing, hugging the over-fed bird closely in his arms,
endeavoured to call him back; but Felizardo knew his own mind. That
evening, just as the cock-fighting was over, he staggered down with the
biggest load of hemp a man had ever brought into the village&mdash;one
or two complained afterwards that he had cleaned up some of their hemp
in addition to his own&mdash;took it into the Spanish
hemp-buyers&rsquo; warehouse, and presently emerged with the best suit
of white linen he could buy.</p>
<p>In after years they used to talk of the look which was on
Felizardo&rsquo;s face that last evening he spent in the village. They
chaffed him, of course&mdash;who but a fool would clean up hemp on a
<span class="corr" id="xd25e368" title=
"Source: festa-day">fiesta-day</span>?&mdash;but he walked past them
all without appearing to notice them. He was not angry&mdash;there was
no question of that; it was only that he seemed to have urgent, and
very pleasant, business of his own on hand. He had become a man apart
from them; and, though none could have foreseen it, he was to remain a
man apart, in a very different sense.</p>
<p>By noon the following day, Felizardo was sitting on the broad, cool
veranda of Juan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>Lasara&rsquo;s house, talking to Dolores. There
was no hurry about business, the Teniente said cheerfully. He himself
was likely to be fully occupied until evening. Let the visitor stay the
night, and on the morrow they would go over and interview Don
Jos&eacute; Ramirez, to whom he had already written&mdash;a proposal
which suited both Dolores and Felizardo.</p>
<p>They talked all that afternoon and all that evening&mdash;the
Teniente was wonderfully discreet in keeping out of the way&mdash;and
when, on the following day, Felizardo took a reluctant farewell, they
were perfectly sure they understood one another. Other people of their
ages have made up their minds, temporarily at least, just as quickly,
even under colder skies than those of the Philippines.</p>
<p>As the two men were going down to the beach&mdash;Calocan lay round
a headland, a long stretch of mangrove swamp, and you had to reach it
by canoe&mdash;they met Father Pablo, apparently going to the
Teniente&rsquo;s. The Teniente stopped a minute and spoke to the priest
in a low voice, then rejoined Felizardo, whilst the Father continued on
his way.</p>
<p>Felizardo thought of Dolores, alone in the house, with only a couple
of servants working in the courtyard, thought of the fat, sensual face,
the self-assertive swagger, and once more that instinct to kill, which
is one of the elemental corollaries of love, came back to him, stronger
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>than ever. For a moment he hesitated, half
inclined to go back; but he had not yet felt the full strength of that
instinct; and so in the end he went on, reluctantly. Juan Lasara,
thinking deeply over the priest&rsquo;s words&mdash;&ldquo;It will be
five thousand pesos now. Don Jos&eacute; has bought a second hemp-patch
from the Friars&rdquo;&mdash;did not notice his hesitation, and might
not have understood it in any case, having got over his days of love,
or at least of the love of woman. He worshipped the peso only.</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute;, white-haired and courtly, was gravely polite to the
Teniente, as a white gentleman must be to a half-caste; but he was
almost cordial to Felizardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already asked the Guardia <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e388" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span>, and they speak well of
you,&rdquo; he said; then, as if fearing his words might seem slighting
to Juan Lasara, he hastened to add: &ldquo;Of course, in any case, the
recommendation of Senor Lasara would suffice. Still, in these days
there are so many ladrones&mdash;you see my shutters and bars? You can
read and write? Yes, the good Friars taught you? Well, then it is
arranged. Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Felizardo became warehouseman, and, in a humble way, junior
clerk, to Don Jos&eacute; Ramirez, to live in the house, and, if need
arose, to fire at ladrones with a musket through one of the loopholes
of those same shutters, an arrangement satisfactory to himself, to the
Spaniard, and perhaps most of all to his patron, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>Teniente
of San Polycarpio. There was no mistaking the cordiality of the
latter&rsquo;s farewell. &ldquo;Come and see us the first
holiday,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I shall be pleased, and&rdquo;&mdash;he
smiled <span class="corr" id="xd25e395" title=
"Source: meaningly">meaningfully</span>&mdash;&ldquo;so will
Dolores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there had been no woman in the case, Felizardo would not have
stayed two days in the warehouse. True, on the rare occasions when he
did see Don Jos&eacute;, the old man was kindness personified; but the
merchant spent his time in his private office, whilst the other clerks,
all mestizos, looked on what they called &ldquo;a wild tao&rdquo; as a
fitting subject for jests and practical jokes. But Felizardo thought of
Dolores, who could only be won by his success in that warehouse;
moreover, he was wiry and strong as a leopard, as the practical jokers
soon learned; consequently, at the end of the first week he had not
only decided to stay, but had also made a definite position for
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good boy, a very good boy,&rdquo; Don Jos&eacute; remarked
to the corporal of the Guardia <span class="corr" id="xd25e402" title=
"Source: Civile">Civil</span>.</p>
<p>The latter nodded. &ldquo;Yes, but watch him. They all want
watching, these Filipinos. I say it with all respect&mdash;but what has
the Holy Church done for them, save teach them our secrets and make
them more dangerous than ever.&rdquo; He sighed heavily, and twirled
his huge, dyed moustache. &ldquo;Thirty years I have been out here, Don
Jos&eacute;, thirty years, and only home to Spain once, and I still
look on them as savages, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>who will get my head in the end. I
shall never see Spain again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; took him by the arm; it was Sunday, and they were
standing on the veranda. &ldquo;Come inside,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
have some choice wine which came in the other day, wine of Spain; and
some cigars such as you could not get elsewhere, even in Spain. Come
inside, corporal, and drink to the day when we both return to
Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Felizardo had borrowed a dug-out canoe, and paddled round
the long headland to San Polycarpio. Dolores was waiting for him.
&ldquo;I knew you would come,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;because
Don Jos&eacute; always closes his warehouse on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The implied assurance in her words made him the happiest man in the
Islands; and as he sat talking to the Teniente that afternoon, he was
very full of the possibilities of a commercial career, and very severe
on the subject of ladrones and the injury they did to trade, which was
perhaps not very pleasant hearing to his host, for after the guest had
gone&mdash;this time Dolores accompanied him down to the
beach&mdash;Lasara remarked to the priest: &ldquo;He will not open the
door of the warehouse, even if I ask him. He is a fool, after
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest shook his head. &ldquo;He will open it, because he is a
special fool on one point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; demanded the other.</p>
<p>Father Pablo smiled grimly. &ldquo;You will see. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>Leave it
to me.&rdquo; And with that promise the Teniente of San Polycarpio had
to be content, though, knowing the priest well, he was not really
uneasy in his own mind. Certainly, they would eventually share those
five thousand pesos of Don Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s, and if, as was
probable, Don Jos&eacute; himself were eliminated during the process of
removal, so much the better. The disappearance of a rival is never felt
very keenly by a good business man.</p>
<p>The pesos for the purchase of the Friars&rsquo; hemp lands came on
the appointed day, and Felizardo helped to carry them into the
warehouse, wondering greatly at the amount, and envying the man who
possessed so much wealth. He was still thinking over the matter at
closing time, when a strange youth hurried up, thrust a note into his
hand, and disappeared as suddenly as he had come. Felizardo read the
letter slowly, and forthwith forgot all about the pesos; for Dolores
was in trouble; Dolores had fled from her father&rsquo;s house, fearing
a forced marriage with a wealthy cousin, who had unexpectedly
re-appeared after years of absence; and, what was most important of
all, Dolores was coming to him for shelter and protection. At eleven
o&rsquo;clock that very night, she would be outside the small door at
the back of the warehouse, where he must join her, and take her
somewhere for safety.</p>
<p>Felizardo sat down on a pile of cases in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>corner
of the warehouse, where he smoked innumerable cigarettes, and tried to
think out the situation. For a moment, he was inclined to consult Don
Jos&eacute;, then dismissed the idea as impossible. It seemed like
treason to Dolores. Above everything, no one must know that she had
come to him secretly, in the dead of night&mdash;no one, that is,
except the person who actually gave her shelter until he could marry
her openly, in the light of day. Yet who would give her shelter? Who
would not talk? He racked his brains for an answer, and then it came to
him&mdash;the good Sisters at the little convent on the far-side of the
plaza. It was only a few moments&rsquo; walk, and when he took Dolores
there, and she knocked, and told her story, and showed the letter she
had written him&mdash;the first line he had ever received from
her&mdash;there would be no question of her welcome or her safety. All
the Tenientes in the Islands would be powerless to wrest her from the
Sisters.</p>
<p>Felizardo waited with almost savage impatience for eleven
o&rsquo;clock. If she missed her way, if by any chance she were
overtaken, if some one should be watching outside to see if she were
coming to him! Full of the latter thought, he slipped into the
warehouse again and searched for a bolo, a particularly fine and keen
weapon, which, only that afternoon, one of his fellow-clerks had bought
from a hill-man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>Felizardo found it, strapped it round his waist,
saw that it was loose in its sheath, crept cautiously to the little
back door, unlocked it, taking the key so as to be able to lock it
again from the outside, took down the heavy bars, opened the door
cautiously&mdash;and saw a dozen figures crouching on the ground, ready
to spring at him.</p>
<p>Then he understood. Like a flash his bolo was out, and, with his
back to the door, he was facing them, shouting, &ldquo;The ladrones,
the ladrones!&rdquo; whilst unconsciously he crumpled up, and dropped,
that forged letter.</p>
<p>It was his first fight. An old man, telling Captain Basil Hayle of
it thirty-five years later, declared that it was his greatest fight;
and Felizardo had then been in hundreds. Be that as it may, the fact
remains that he had killed two ladrones, and mortally wounded two more,
himself receiving only a gash across the forehead, before help came, in
the form of the Guardia <span class="corr" id="xd25e438" title=
"Source: Civile">Civil</span> from without, and Don Jos&eacute; and his
five men from within.</p>
<p>Of the twelve ladrones, only four escaped, crawling away wounded.
Four they killed out of hand, and four more, including Cinicio Dagujob
himself, they hanged on that new gallows opposite Don
Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s warehouse, as a warning to all men.</p>
<p>Felizardo staggered back against the wall, half-blinded by the blood
from his forehead, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17"
name="pb17">17</a>]</span>trembling, as a man does after his first
fight; then, without the slightest premeditation, he made the mistake
of his life. He slipped away in the darkness, down to the beach,
launched a canoe, and began frenziedly to paddle towards San
Polycarpio. He had remembered Dolores and her possible peril, and
forgotten all else&mdash;Don Jos&eacute;, the Guardia <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e447" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span>, the questions
he would be expected to answer.</p>
<p>The corporal asked one of those same questions of Don Jos&eacute;
half an hour later, after the prisoners had been safely locked in the
cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave the alarm?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felizardo,&rdquo; the merchant answered. &ldquo;He was
fighting in the doorway when we rushed down, fighting like a dozen
devils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal frowned. &ldquo;Then he must have opened the door
himself. Why? Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; poured himself out another glass of wine with a
rather shaky hand. He was an old man, and his nerves were upset.
&ldquo;Felizardo is gone, they tell me. They have searched, thinking he
might be lying wounded, but they cannot find a trace
anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the corporal frowned, and drummed on the table with his
fingers. He was not very brilliant, and he was trying to construct a
theory. At last, &ldquo;Let them search again,&rdquo; he said
severely.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, one of the clerks came <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>back
with a crumpled slip of paper in his hand. &ldquo;We have found this,
Senor,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The corporal handed it to Don Jos&eacute;&mdash;despite that huge,
dyed moustache and his straight back, his eyes were growing old, and
one does not take spectacles when one is on service. &ldquo;Will you
read it, Don Jos&eacute;, read it aloud slowly?&rdquo; he asked with
dignity, then turned a fierce gaze on the knot of clerks gathered in
the doorway, who fled hurriedly.</p>
<p>When the merchant had finished, the corporal brought his hand down
on the table with a thump which made all the wine-glasses dance.
&ldquo;A love affair, as I think I said, or rather a false assignation.
He has got frightened at his mistake, and gone to the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; sighed. &ldquo;I liked him. He is a good, sensible
boy, and I hope he will come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal shook his head. &ldquo;He will never come back. Thirty
years I have been here, in this service, only going home to Spain once,
and I should know that they are only savages, after all. I think I have
said before that the Holy Church makes a mistake in trying to tame
them. Let them be brought to hear Mass every Sunday&mdash;that would be
only fitting, and would doubtless save their souls, if they have
any&mdash;but books and learning are not for them. When I get back to
Spain I shall make a journey to Rome to tell his Holiness these things.
Doubtless, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>he will listen to an old soldier of
Spain&#8202;&hellip;. No, Don Jos&eacute;, your Felizardo will never
come back here. Yet&rdquo;&mdash;he sighed regretfully&mdash;&ldquo;he
is a fine fighter. He was the only one on our side with a bolo, and two
have been killed with the bolo, and two wounded so badly that we must
hurry on the hanging of them. A fine fighter&mdash;but what will
you&mdash;&mdash;? They are all savages at heart, as I hope to tell his
Holiness one day.&rdquo; He stood up abruptly, saluted, and stalked out
with his hand on the hilt of his great sabre.</p>
<p>There was only one light showing in San Polycarpio when Felizardo
beached his canoe on the shingle by the palm grove; and only one mangy
dog, which relapsed into silence after the first stone, noted his
arrival. On the other hand, the light was in the Teniente&rsquo;s
house, which made things easier for the newcomer.</p>
<p>Felizardo had bandaged his forehead with a strip torn off his shirt,
and as soon as he came to the stream of fresh water which ran down the
one long street, he bathed the blood from his face carefully. He did
not want to alarm Dolores&mdash;about himself. Then, bolo in hand, he
made his way to the house, clambered cautiously on to the veranda, and
peered in through a tiny hole in the matting blind. He could see very
little&mdash;only Dolores standing, pale and trembling, against the
further wall, and the heads of Lasara and Father Pablo, who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>were seated at the table. But he could hear, and
that was almost better than seeing.</p>
<p>The voices were a little thick&mdash;it had been a weary task
waiting for the return of the messenger Cinicio Dagujob was to send,
and the native spirit had been very strong&mdash;but the priest, at
least, knew what he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must let her come to me as housekeeper,&rdquo; he was
saying. &ldquo;You would like that, wouldn&rsquo;t you,
girl&rdquo;&mdash;he turned towards Dolores&mdash;&ldquo;to keep house
for your parish priest? I would get rid of the other. Answer me, Juan
Lasara. Will you agree, or shall I denounce you as Cinicio&rsquo;s
partner?&rdquo; There was a snarl in his voice. &ldquo;After
to-night&rsquo;s work there will be a hue-and-cry; and you remember the
new gallows at Calocan. Answer me, you ladrone Teniente of San
Polycarpio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the reply did not come from Juan Lasara. With one cut of his
bolo Felizardo cleared away the matting, and was in the room. Dolores
gave a scream and fainted; Lasara fumbled drunkenly for his knife, and,
failing to find it, seized a bottle; but the priest stood back
unarmed&mdash;trembling, perhaps, but still apparently secure in the
protection of his cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare not touch me,&rdquo; he said. And for answer
Felizardo slew him with a single slash of that terrible bolo. Then he
dealt with Lasara, whom he maimed for life; and after that he gathered
together the remains of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href=
"#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>food and the wine&mdash;he was
looking ahead even then&mdash;put out the lamp, took the insensible
girl in his arms, and made his way to the jungle.</p>
<p>So in the one night Felizardo killed two ladrones and a priest who
was worse than a ladrone, secured the hanging of two others, and then,
possibly because, as the corporal said, he was a savage at heart, took
Dolores Lasara with him to the hills, and became a ladrone himself.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2 class="main">HOW THE CORPORAL WENT BACK TO SPAIN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For six months the tao of the district talked of
Felizardo, the man who had slain a priest; then, as nothing more had
been heard of the outlaw, and a new band of ladrones had been formed in
the neighbourhood of Calocan, the centre of interest shifted, and the
crime at San Polycarpio, if not forgotten, at least ceased to be
discussed.</p>
<p>The tao knew nothing about Father Pablo&rsquo;s connection with the
band of the late Cinicio Dagujob&mdash;the Church had seen to that fact
being suppressed&mdash;but the corporal knew, in fact he had been the
first to suspect it, and he took the information across to Don
Jos&eacute; Ramirez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Pablo was a mestizo,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You knew
him, I suppose. No? A big scoundrel, gross and burly. I wonder why the
Church will allow natives to be priests. I am sure the Holy Father
cannot know. Some day, perhaps, I may have the chance of telling him,
if I get back to Spain. A villain, that Pablo; but still <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>your
Felizardo was wrong to kill him. Nothing can save him now. I told you
that night, even after we found how splendidly he had boloed those
ladrones, that he would not come back. I was right, of course. Have I
not been thirty years in these accursed Islands, and if I do not know
the Filipinos, who should know them, Senor? A fine fighter, that
Felizardo. Had he been in our native troops, he would have risen high.
And now, because he is a savage at heart, he has become a
ladrone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; sighed&mdash;there had been a romance and a tragedy
in his own life, many years before, in Spain. &ldquo;No, corporal. He
went because he loved one woman too well to leave her to some one
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal twisted his moustache. &ldquo;Therein he was a savage,
as I said before. He got one idea in his mind, and he could not forget
it, not having room for two. I have loved women, Senor, and women have
loved me, many of them; but as for turning highwayman, or at least
outlaw, for the sake of one&mdash;pouf!&rdquo; He shook his head with a
great assumption of scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Don Jos&eacute; smiled. They had been friends
for many years, these two, and he knew the story of the girl in Spain
whom the other had gone back to marry&mdash;and found dead; therefore,
he always listened patiently to those stories of subsequent love
affairs, none of which ever had the slightest foundation in fact.
&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24"
name="pb24">24</a>]</span>he repeated. &ldquo;Then you think a man
should have as many wives as he can get, like a Moor or a
Chino?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&rdquo;&mdash;the corporal frowned&mdash;&ldquo;the
Church would not allow that, only&mdash;well,&rdquo; he got up rather
hastily. &ldquo;I was forgetting the time. I must be off. After thirty
years&rsquo; service in these accursed Islands, one must not begin to
neglect one&rsquo;s duty, Senor.&rdquo; At the door he stopped and
looked back. &ldquo;Think no more of your Felizardo, Don Jos&eacute;.
He will never return; and, if he did, we should have to hang him. A
fine fighter, certainly&mdash;but, to kill a priest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you say the priest was also a ladrone,&rdquo; the
merchant objected.</p>
<p>The corporal shook his head. &ldquo;A priest is a priest, and the
Church will not forgive, or admit excuses. How can she, when she has
the souls of all these savages to save? Still, if I ever get the chance
of seeing the Holy Father, and explaining&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he
went out, still frowning and shaking his head.</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; helped himself slowly to another glass of wine, and
sighed. &ldquo;We shall never go back to Spain, he and I. It is getting
too late now, and so&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled sadly&mdash;&ldquo;the Holy
Father will lose much useful information.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>When Felizardo slew Pablo the priest, and took to the bush, carrying
Dolores Lasara in his arms, he had no definite aim, save that of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>gaining a temporary hiding-place; but the moment
he had found this, and even whilst he was bringing the girl round with
some of the wine he had taken from her father&rsquo;s table&mdash;the
bottle itself was sticky with her father&rsquo;s blood&mdash;his mind
became busy with the problem of the future.</p>
<p>He was an outlaw for life. He had killed a priest&mdash;had offended
far beyond the offence of the ordinary ladrone, who only kills ordinary
men, and tortures women and children. True, the priest was a ladrone,
even worse than a ladrone, but it was the cloth, and not the man
beneath it, which mattered. Felizardo faced the issue squarely.
Somehow, it seemed as though he had learned many things during that
night. He had taken up the bolo, and thenceforth the Law of the Bolo
must be his only code. A few hours before, no one had less desire to be
an outlaw than he; now, he had become an outlaw, despite himself; but
he did not rail against Fate, because he was an Asiatic, and also
because, after all, he had got Dolores.</p>
<p>Still, there was one trouble, which would be greater for her than
for him. He put it to her very gently after he had told her of the end
of Father Pablo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot be married now, dear one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No
priest would do it, even though I captured him, and threatened him with
death.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>She looked at him with shining eyes. &ldquo;What matter? I shall
have you, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away. &ldquo;It is not too late for you to go back, even
now. The good Sisters at the convent would take you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer, she kissed him, the first kiss she had ever given him,
and they said no more of that matter.</p>
<p>From Felizardo&rsquo;s own village, from every village for miles
round in fact, you can see a great range of mountains, rugged and
forbidding, beginning practically at the shore of a huge bay and
running inland for many miles. The lower slopes of the range are
covered with dense jungle; but when you have climbed a thousand feet or
so, you leave all this behind, and find bald rock, and lava-beds, and
ashes, for there are half a dozen active volcanoes there, as well as
many which are merely quiescent, and hot springs, and geysers, and
other dangers to life and peace of mind.</p>
<p>Felizardo had often looked at those mountains, especially when he
had been fishing in the bay, waiting lazily for a bite. Then, they had
always seemed to suggest harshness and danger, the very antithesis to
the dreamy life amongst the cocoa-nut groves and the hemp-patches; now,
however, he thought of them in a very different light, as offering an
ideal refuge; and even if, as was rumoured, they were the home of many
bad men&mdash;well, was he, himself, not a bad man too? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>He made up his mind quickly. It was no use thinking of remaining in
the jungle by the coast. He was not greatly afraid of the authorities
finding him, although the Church might insist on a hue-and-cry of an
unusually vigorous nature; but he was afraid of coming across some of
the local ladrones, who would assuredly take vengeance on him for what
he had done to their friends. So, at the first streak of dawn he and
Dolores set out for the mountains, where the rest of their lives were
to be spent.</p>
<p>It was a long and slow journey, for Dolores was not used to the
bush, and they had to avoid all footpaths and villages. Time after
time, Felizardo had to carry her through those steep-banked, narrow
little streams, which on the paths you cross by shaky pole-bridges; and
twice he had to cut down hemp-palms, and make rafts on which to get to
the other bank of larger streams. The second night out it rained, a
veritable deluge; but he had foreseen it, and had made a little shelter
of palm-leaves, which kept them perfectly dry, greatly to the surprise
of Dolores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know everything, and to be prepared for
everything,&rdquo; she said; and he felt prouder than he had ever felt
in his life.</p>
<p>Early next morning, whilst she still slept, he went out to a
neighbouring village, where they were also asleep, and when she
awakened he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>was plucking a newly-killed fowl, whilst there was
a basket of sweet potatoes beside him. It was his first definite act of
ladronism, and he shifted uneasily under her gaze, until she,
understanding, laid a soft hand on his arm and said: &ldquo;They drove
you to it, dearest, and you have done it for me;&rdquo; so Felizardo
enjoyed his meal after all.</p>
<p>That night, Felizardo went much further. He found a water-buffalo
belonging to the priest of the village they were skirting; and from
that point onwards, until they were well up the lower slopes of the
range, there was plenty of meat, whilst, of course, if you are a
Filipino, you can always find sweet potatoes, and beans, and
cocoa-nuts.</p>
<p>They built a little shelter in the jungle, and there they lived like
children of nature for a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be content to stay here for ever,&rdquo; Dolores
said; but the man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will rain every day soon, and then you would die. There
are caves on the slope overlooking the bay. We will take one. Then we
can store a supply of food, and, if I can get a pig and some fowls from
one of the villages in the valley, we shall have no need to
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first two caves they explored were damp and dark, then they went
into a third&mdash;and came on two men and a woman, sitting in the
entrance, smoking some fish. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href=
"#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>The men sprang to their feet, and one, the elder, came forward, bolo
in hand; but the woman held the other back. &ldquo;He may not be an
enemy, and at least be fair,&rdquo; she cried, for which Dolores loved
her ever afterwards.</p>
<p>The other man was a little unsteady&mdash;there was a jar of spirits
beside the fire&mdash;and his eyes were staring and bloodshot. He did
not stop to ask any questions, and Felizardo said nothing, except, very
quietly: &ldquo;Go back, Dolores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not a fight: it did not last more than a few seconds; then,
as he wiped his bolo on the white tunic of his attacker, Felizardo
looked at the man beside the fire: &ldquo;And you now?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>The other shook his head, and sheathed the bolo, which, despite the
woman&rsquo;s efforts, he had drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the better man,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;And
he,&rdquo; nodding towards the body&mdash;&ldquo;he was a
scoundrel;&rdquo; whereat the woman gave a queer little sob, gratitude,
relief, horror perhaps, which brought Dolores running to her side, and
they cried together; whilst the men carried the body out, and threw it
over the cliff, returning with dry earth with which to cover the
stains.</p>
<p>They sat down beside the fire, Felizardo in his late foe&rsquo;s
place, and the stranger poured out some spirit, which they drank in
silence.</p>
<p>After a while Felizardo spoke. &ldquo;Why did you come up here, on
the mountains?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30"
name="pb30">30</a>]</span></p>
<p>The stranger, whose name was Carlos, pointed to the woman: &ldquo;I
took her from a convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Felizardo smiled grimly. &ldquo;And I killed a priest, for
her,&rdquo; nodding towards Dolores.</p>
<p>Carlos leaned forward quickly. &ldquo;Are you named Felizardo? I
thought so. Even here, on the mountains, we hear things&#8202;&hellip;.
Let me, let us, stay here with you in this cave&mdash;as I said, you
are the better man and can take it if you will&mdash;but I can help
you; and the women will not be lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer, Felizardo held out his hand; and so was started his
band, which afterwards became the most famous in the Islands.</p>
<p>The band grew rapidly, as is the way of such organisations, when the
leader is infinitely stronger than any of his followers; then, after a
while, Felizardo determined to weed it out. He would have no men who
were outlaws merely because of their own vicious natures, to whom
ladronism was a natural calling. There were many of these already in
the mountains, and they formed a rival band against him, on hearing of
which he sallied out one night and cut them to pieces. From that time
onwards, for many years, no native challenged his sovereign rights over
the mountain range.</p>
<p>He made peace with the tribe of head-hunters, who were his northern
neighbours, respecting their customs, so long as they took none of his
men&rsquo;s heads, and with the tao to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>the south, from whom he
bought live-stock, the money he gave being obtained from Presidentes
and Tenientes and planters, and other folk who oppress the common
people, though it was taken as tribute, Felizardo not being a midnight
robber, like Cinicio Dagujob had been.</p>
<p>News might go up from the coastal towns to the mountains, in fact it
did go freely&mdash;news of what the Government was doing, of how the
Presidentes and Tenientes were robbing the tao, of where the Guardia
<span class="corr" id="xd25e605" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span>
was; but very little came down from the mountains, at least to the
white men, and, of that little, practically none reached Calocan.
Consequently, five years after Felizardo had turned ladrone, neither
Don Jos&eacute; nor the corporal knew that he was the chief of the big
band, consisting of outlaws rather than of ladrones, of which they had
heard vague rumours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in the mountains&mdash;pouf! I should let them stay
there,&rdquo; the corporal said. &ldquo;They do not seem to do much
harm, and it would cost a fabulous sum to hunt them out from amongst
the caves and craters;&rdquo; an opinion with which Don Jos&eacute;,
being already heavily taxed, agreed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Felizardo is there,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The corporal shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Who knows? Let me
see&mdash;he went four, or was it five, years ago. Five, that is it.
Probably he is dead by now; he was not of the true ladrone <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>breed.
Anyway, I was right when I said he would never come back, just as I was
right when I said I should never go home to Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you applied for your pension?&rdquo; the merchant
asked.</p>
<p>The old soldier drew himself up. &ldquo;How can I, Senor, when I am
still active, and&mdash;and not old, declare I am no longer fit for my
work? No, if they offer it, I shall take it; but until they
offer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he went out, shaking his head.</p>
<p>That night a runner came in with a message for the corporal. A large
band of ladrones, or rather a combination of a number of small bands,
had raided and burned the village of Igut, which was about ten miles
from the foot of the mountains, on the edge of the bay. Most of the tao
had been killed; the Spanish trader had been tortured to death, and all
the women and girls carried off. Troops were being hurried from
Manila&mdash;in the Spanish way of hurrying, which did not mean
much&mdash;but, meanwhile, all the small detachments were to go in
pursuit. The corporal was to take two of his troopers, and twenty of
the native soldiers attached to his post.</p>
<p>It was a great grief to the corporal that he had to make the trip by
canoe in order to save time. He disliked service on foot, being a
little stiff and short of wind; whilst, more important than that, it
was always more dignified to ride <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"
href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>in full uniform, at the head of
your men. Now, however, not only his horse, but his great thigh-boots
as well, would have to remain behind. Even his sabre must be carried by
a native orderly. Still, as he said to Don Jos&eacute;, who came to the
landing-stage to see him off, one&rsquo;s duty came before one&rsquo;s
sense of dignity, and an old soldier of Spain could afford to do things
which would make a lesser man look absurd.</p>
<p>They landed on the beach at Igut, which now consisted of some piles
of still-smoking ashes, a hundred or two charred posts, the remains of
the nipa-houses, and the blackened walls of the church and the Spanish
merchant&rsquo;s house. There were bodies everywhere, slashed hideously
with bolo-cuts; and beside the post in the plaza, where they had done
him to death, in the hope of making him confess how he had hidden the
wealth he did not possess, was all that remained of the Spanish
merchant himself; seeing which, the corporal swore great oaths,
unconsciously drew his hand across his eyes&mdash;curious how dim they
were growing!&mdash;then, like a good Catholic, knelt down and prayed
for the soul of the man he had never seen in life; and after that he
donned the parade uniform he had brought in case of emergency, buckled
on his sabre, and carried out the funeral of his fellow-countryman.</p>
<p>There was no trace of the other detachments which were supposed to
be coming; but that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34"
name="pb34">34</a>]</span>fact did not weigh with the corporal. He had
been ordered to pursue the ladrones, so he marched inland on the trail
of the robbers. It was not difficult to follow them, at least for the
first few miles; they were a large body, and they were taking along
much loot and many prisoners. A little way out, the pursuers came on
the body of a woman, and then those of two children, all boloed,
apparently because they could not travel.</p>
<p>The trail led towards the foot of the range of mountains,
Felizardo&rsquo;s territory; and the corporal groaned involuntarily. He
had to keep at the head of his little force, yet he was very stiff, and
the climbing tried him severely. Once or twice, he was sorely inclined
to call a halt, just to get his breath again; but he could not let his
native soldiers see any signs of weakness, and so he struggled on. It
was rather curious. After thirty-five years&rsquo; service, a man
should be fit for anything, inured to all hardships. Probably it was
only fancy after all, he told himself, as he squared his shoulders, and
looked back sternly for any possible stragglers. Then suddenly, his
orderly, who was just behind him, cried out that he had seen a ladrone
scout, moving amongst the trees; and a moment later, almost before the
corporal had time to take his sabre from the orderly, the ladrones were
on them, three to one, cutting and slashing with their bolos. The
corporal&rsquo;s men, winded and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>exhausted, fired a volley from
their muskets, but only one of the enemy was hit, and there was no
chance of reloading. It became a case of the butt-end against the bolo,
and, naturally, the bolo won. A few seconds afterwards, the corporal,
one of his white troopers, and a native sergeant were the only
survivors in sight, standing with their backs to a huge tree.</p>
<p>The corporal had drawn his pistol with his left hand, but a slash
from a bolo had taken off three of his fingers before he could fire,
though he was hardly conscious of the fact. All he knew was that he
must die like a soldier of Spain, with his sabre in his hand.</p>
<p>For a minute, they kept the bolomen at bay, then the native sergeant
went down, and the enemy began to close in, twenty of them, at
least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is over. Good-bye!&rdquo; the corporal cried to his one
remaining comrade.</p>
<p>There had never been any chance, and now there were more bolomen
coming, scores of them, rushing down the hillside, yelling. The
corporal braced himself up. His strength was almost gone, but he meant
to kill one more enemy of Spain before he himself was killed.</p>
<p>And then a miracle seemed to happen. Suddenly, there was not an
enemy within reach of his sabre, for boloman was fighting boloman, or,
rather, the newcomers were slaying his enemies for him. The corporal
lowered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>the point of his sabre&mdash;he had lost a great
deal of blood, and the weight of the weapon now seemed almost
unbearable&mdash;then he turned to his comrade with a question in his
eyes, and, before the other had time to answer, lurched forward in a
dead faint.</p>
<p>When the corporal recovered his senses, he was lying on a pile of
blankets under a palm-leaf shelter. His left hand, which was bandaged
up, was very painful&mdash;that was his first impression; then he began
to remember, vaguely at the outset, seeing everything as through a mist
of blood, which cleared away suddenly when it struck him that he was a
prisoner amongst the ladrones, and he knew how ladrones treated Spanish
prisoners. Better to have died there, at the foot of the big tree.
Still, they should get no sign of weakness from him.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes whilst he repeated a prayer, then opened them
again, to see a native, whose face was somehow familiar, standing
beside him, regarding him with grave interest.</p>
<p>The corporal returned the look, then raised himself on his unwounded
arm. &ldquo;You are Felizardo!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Felizardo nodded. &ldquo;Yes, Senor, it is Felizardo. You remember
last time, outside Don Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s warehouse, you saved me?
Now&rdquo;&mdash;he bowed slightly&mdash;&ldquo;I am able to save you,
also from ladrones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal lay back again. This was an unprecedented situation,
for which there was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37"
name="pb37">37</a>]</span>no provision made in the Regulations; for
this same Felizardo was a ladrone who had slain a priest. At first, he
tried to think what would be the correct thing to do; but in the end he
could only jerk out a question: &ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Felizardo waved his hand. &ldquo;Those ladrones who burned Igut
captured some of my men&rsquo;s wives&mdash;that was all. We came on
you by chance, and I was glad to pay my debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal breathed heavily. He did not intend to show any
anxiety, but he wanted to know his fate. &ldquo;And now?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Felizardo smiled slightly. &ldquo;Now, if you like, you may go back
to Calocan at once; or, if you would honour me, stay with me in my
mountains until your wound is healed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From any other native, the mere invitation, even without the phrase
&ldquo;my mountains,&rdquo; would have stirred the corporal&rsquo;s
deepest wrath; but somehow he realised, almost with a sense of
humiliation, that this native was a stronger man than himself. For a
moment, he was inclined to accept, then he remembered he must go back
and report&mdash;his defeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Felizardo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must go
back;&rdquo; he looked away and went on, a little brokenly:
&ldquo;Thank you, Senor. I told Don Jos&eacute; we should never see you
again, either of us. Now I, at least, have seen you, and I am glad,
and&mdash;and very grateful.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38"
href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>Again Felizardo smiled. &ldquo;So you told Don Jos&eacute; that?
Well, we shall see;&rdquo; and he began to walk away slowly.</p>
<p>The corporal called him back. &ldquo;I might get you a pardon, even
now, though &hellip; you know &hellip; the
Church&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man&rsquo;s face grew hard. &ldquo;I take no
pardons,&rdquo; he said sternly; then he shrugged his shoulders and
laughed. &ldquo;And, anyway, Senor, they would grant none. Still, it
was kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They carried the corporal down to Igut, where to his surprise he
found eight survivors out of his force, and they put him on board a
canoe, after what seemed a day&rsquo;s unnecessary delay. Then they
started back to Calocan, his own men paddling the canoe. The corporal
was very unhappy. He knew now that he must be invalided out of the
service: not honourably, however, but in disgrace, for his haste, or
rather his over-devotion to duty, had brought disaster on the arms of
Spain.</p>
<p>True, it would be a difficult matter to explain, for the women and
children and the loot as well were back in Igut, and the surviving men
had crept in from the jungle and begun to rebuild the nipa-houses,
whilst, as a price for his rescue, Felizardo had made him promise not
to tell how the mountaineers had rescued him. He wished now he had not
given that promise&mdash;it was, probably, like the rest of the
business, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>contrary to the Regulations&mdash;but, having
given it, he must abide by it. He puzzled over the matter all the way
back to Calocan, wondering what his men would say, not knowing that
they had received orders on that point&mdash;orders which they now dare
not disobey&mdash;from Felizardo himself.</p>
<p>When the canoe reached Calocan, the whole population was waiting on
the beach to greet him. They cheered, and they crowded round him, and
the women showered blessings on him; whilst there was even an orderly
from Manila, commanding him to go to the Governor-General himself, a
Grandee of Spain, as soon as his wounds permitted. The corporal flushed
and stammered and looked round helplessly; then Don Jos&eacute; came
forward and took his arm. &ldquo;Come up to my house. It will be quiet
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the corporal into the well-remembered room, which, somehow,
seemed different now to the visitor, possibly because he had always
entered it before as a proud and important man, whilst this time he
felt himself an impostor. He took his glass of wine with trembling
hands, put it to his lips, then set it down untasted. He might have to
deceive every one else, but he could not be false to this old friend.
He drew his hand across his forehead slowly, then he blurted out:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie. I was beaten. I thought all my men were
killed.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; leaned forward and laid a hand on his arm. &ldquo;I
know the truth, my friend&mdash;everything. Felizardo told
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal sat up erect in his chair and gasped. &ldquo;Felizardo?
When? How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this room, last night. He came alone, by canoe, and walked
straight in. He wanted me to see you said nothing foolish, and he
wanted to prove you had been wrong when you said he would never come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full minute they sat in silence, then the corporal broke out.
&ldquo;He is a strong man, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a gentleman, Senor, even if he did kill a
priest;&rdquo; there was almost a note of defiance in the
corporal&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Again Don Jos&eacute; nodded.</p>
<p>There was another spell of silence, which was broken by the merchant
saying: &ldquo;You will do as he wishes? You will hear all, and say
nothing? Then you will go back to Spain with your pension. Why not? You
tried your best; you held up the ladrones&mdash;you,
single-handed&mdash;and gave Felizardo his chance. It was your victory,
after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took the corporal&rsquo;s reticence and his rather muddled
statements as the results of the wound he had received, coupled with
his modesty. How could one doubt when one had been to Igut and seen the
released prisoners, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>restored loot, and the heads of the
ladrones stuck on posts along the beach?</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; came to Manila to see him start on his journey to
Spain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you see the Holy Father&mdash;now?&rdquo; the merchant
asked.</p>
<p>The corporal&rsquo;s eyes brightened. &ldquo;Why, yes, if I can. Why
should I have changed&mdash;I, who have had thirty-five years in which
to learn the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; laughed. &ldquo;But has not Felizardo changed you?
Is he only a savage, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment, the corporal was at a loss, then, &ldquo;If he had not
been educated, he would never have been able to read that letter, and
would not have had to take to the hills,&rdquo; he answered stoutly.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2 class="main">HOW CAPTAIN BASIL HAYLE WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The corporal never went to Rome, after all, and, as a
result, his message to the Holy Father remained undelivered. True, he
talked about going often during the ten years which elapsed before he
himself was gathered to his mundane fathers, but, somehow, life was
very pleasant in his own little village, where there were no ladrones
to worry you, and plenty of untravelled folk ready to listen to your
stories of ladrones. Moreover, Rome was a long way off, a very long
way, and the journey needed many preparations; so, in the end, the only
journey he did make was when he went on a visit to Don Jos&eacute;
Ramirez, who had also come home, rich and very weary.</p>
<p>They talked of Calocan, of San Polycarpio, and of the new gallows,
on which Cinicio Dagujob was hanged, of many familiar spots and old
friends; but most of all they talked of Felizardo and his doings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were both wrong,&rdquo; the corporal said. &ldquo;He came
back to Calocan, and we have come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43"
href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>back to Spain. Curious, I am
seldom wrong; but I was over those matters. Still, even an old soldier
of thirty-five years&rsquo; service may make mistakes
sometimes&#8202;&hellip;. You say Felizardo is still in those same
mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He, at least, will never go back to his home to stay,&rdquo;
the corporal went on. &ldquo;If there were nothing else, there is the
Church, you know.&rdquo; He shook his head gravely. &ldquo;Felizardo
killed a priest, and even though that Father Pablo was a ladrone, the
cloth remains, always. And the Church does not forget. How can she
afford to forget, with all those half-heathen souls to be
saved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corporal stayed a week in Don Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s big house, and
then he went home to his own little house, in the village at the foot
of the mountains, and with that both he and Don Jos&eacute; Ramirez go
out of this story, leaving only Felizardo and Dolores Lasara, who were
still in the mountains in the distant Philippines, outlaws and, if you
will, ladrones.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The corporal had been dead twenty years when Captain Basil Hayle,
who was then only Serjeant Hayle of the Garrison Artillery, United
States Army, landed in Manila. From the transport, he had seen a great
range of mountains, running right down to the sea, and had admired them
in his silent way, though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href=
"#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>he made no remark about them, even to
the comrade who was leaning on the rail beside him, for, as a rule, the
more he liked a thing, the less he said about it. It was only when his
aversion was roused that he was moved to speech. If any one had told
him then that those same mountains, and the people on them, were
destined to play the most important part in his life, he might not have
disbelieved the statement&mdash;in fact, he had a vein of superstition,
or fatalism, which might have inclined him to believe it&mdash;but he
would have gone on just the same until the crisis arrived.</p>
<p>Basil Hayle came of good stock on both sides. His father had been a
Virginian, his mother a Swedish girl, a combination which usually turns
out well, both the breeds being good ones. From his father he had
inherited his sense of chivalry, his inability to know when he was
beaten, and a certain deceptive strength which looked like laziness;
from his mother had come his tall figure, his fair hair, and his
unwillingness to cause unnecessary pain.</p>
<p>When, on the outbreak of the war, Basil Hayle had volunteered for
the front, they had drafted him into the Garrison Artillery on account
of his size and apparent slowness, qualities which are usually
considered more suitable in garrison gunners than in any other branch
of the service; but they quickly discovered that they had misjudged
their man. The superfluous flesh he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>recently acquired during
a leisurely trip to Europe was soon got rid of, his education raised
him above the level of the majority of his comrades, and before the
transport left San Francisco he was a full Serjeant. Still, he was in
the Garrison Artillery, and a garrison gunner he had to remain, kicking
his heels in a sweltering fort on the shore of Cavite Bay&mdash;with
his largest gun he could almost have thrown a shell on to the lower
slopes of Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains&mdash;whilst the other regiments
were having a splendid time amongst the insurrectos.</p>
<p>As every one knows, the Americans went to the Philippines to save
the Filipinos from the Spanish tyranny; and, as is also well known, the
Filipinos responded in characteristic fashion. For a few brief weeks,
the agitators in the towns believed, and proclaimed, that the
millennium had come, the reign of Liberty, Equality, and
Fraternity&mdash;Liberty to do what was good in your own sight, and
evil in the sight of every decent man; Equality, so far as the goods of
a richer man than yourself were concerned; Fraternity in the
Cain-and-Abel sense. The tao repeated the words, taking them to mean
that the Presidentes and Tenientes would be hanged, and that there
would be cock-fights every day of the week; the ladrones took them to
mean the entire abolition of any form of police; but old Felizardo, who
was now sixty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>years of age and the wisest man in the Islands,
laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Americanos will let them bolo one another for a
while,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;then they will send an army to put those
who remain in order. Still, it is not my quarrel. I claim nothing
beyond my mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None the less, he strengthened the outposts on the lower slopes of
the range, and when the Provisional Government in Manila sent envoys to
ask him to join them, the rather nervous mestizos who brought the
message were sent back, very flustered, with their mission unfulfilled.
Then came other envoys, truculent ones this time, with orders to
Felizardo to make his submission to the Sovereign People, the latter
being represented by a few score of coffee-coloured little men in khaki
uniforms, with huge red sashes, huge red epaulettes, and even more huge
sabres, which they loved to jangle over the cobble-stones of the towns,
greatly to their own glory, and much to the detriment of their
scabbards. Felizardo, hearing of them, laughed again&mdash;his official
uniform was a suit of white duck and a broad-brimmed straw
hat&mdash;then he said to Dolores, whose girlish prettiness had changed
now to a sweet-faced dignity: &ldquo;The corporal of the Guardia
<span class="corr" id="xd25e764" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span> at
Calocan&mdash;you remember, the old one&mdash;would alone have put them
to flight, beating them with the flat of his sword. They tell me those
patriots have hewn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span>down the gallows at Calocan. Well, it was
old; and, in any case, the Americanos would doubtless have put up a new
one&mdash;for these patriots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when the second deputation, that to demand his instant
submission to the will of the Sovereign People, arrived, and Felizardo
heard that the envoys were generals, wearing that same gorgeous
uniform, he waxed wroth, and ordered that those distinguished
soldier-diplomats should be brought to him. &ldquo;Bring them, sabres,
revolvers, and all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let them climb the
mountains, and climb rather fast, as I am in a hurry to see the great
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly, his orders were taken too literally. At any rate, two of
the envoys fainted half way up the mountain-side, and had to be revived
with pricks from the point of a bolo; whilst even the third, who was of
a tougher breed, had none of his truculence left when he found himself
face to face with that quiet, wizened little man. Moreover, the ends of
the scabbards were worn and dented beyond all hope of repair, and when,
in obedience to Felizardo&rsquo;s order, the owners attempted to draw
their sabres in salute, not one of them could get the blade out.</p>
<p>One or two of Felizardo&rsquo;s men&mdash;there were over a hundred
clustered round&mdash;laughed; but the chief himself looked grave.
&ldquo;Patriot generals should do better than that,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I fear you would be certain to die for your <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>country
if an enemy were to meet you in that state. I can remember the days
when our people were content with a bolo in a wooden sheath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A laugh went round the semicircle of his followers, each of whom had
one of the weapons in question strapped round his waist. But the envoys
did not laugh. Somehow, Felizardo&rsquo;s courtesy seemed to jar on
their nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here, on my mountains? Where is the message
you have to bring me?&rdquo; The chiefs manner changed suddenly.</p>
<p>The envoys exchanged glances; then the eldest of them, rather
reluctantly, produced an official-looking document, decorated with a
large seal. Felizardo read the paper carefully, then handed it to a
youngster who was standing behind his chair. &ldquo;Burn that,
Enrique,&rdquo; he said; and after that he turned to the envoys again.
&ldquo;What are your names, O Generals of the Sovereign People?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>They gave him names, and then, after telling the eldest to stand to
one side, he called to his men. &ldquo;Do you know these two?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>One they identified as the late door-keeper at the Palace, and the
other as a money-lender in a Manila suburb.</p>
<p>Felizardo nodded; then he beckoned to the third man. &ldquo;You are
the son of Cinicio Dagujob,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You were one of the
band of ladrones which burned San Juan two years ago. Do not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>deny it. I know you.&rdquo; Then he nodded to his
men. &ldquo;Hang him,&rdquo; he said curtly; and they led the general
away, sullen, defiant, unresisting, a ladrone to the end, and hanged
him, with his great sabre still on him.</p>
<p>After that, Felizardo called up the other two. &ldquo;You shall go
back to Manila, with this message from Felizardo.&mdash;Your government
talks of the will of the Sovereign People and the Law of Liberty. I,
Felizardo, say that here, in my mountains, where I am the sovereign
chief, there is only one law, the Law of the Bolo, to which every man
becomes subject the moment he sets foot on my land. Tell them that in
Manila. See that you tell it faithfully, lest I come down to Manila and
tell it them myself. And now, O Generals of the Sovereign People, you
shall be well flogged, so that you may remember Felizardo, and then you
shall go back with the message of the Bolo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Provisional Government passed a resolution, or rather a series
of resolutions, on the subject of Felizardo, declaring him to be a
rebel, an outlaw, a tyrant, and an Enemy of the People, whilst a bishop
whom it had appointed&mdash;ratification from Rome was sure to come to
Catholic patriots&mdash;solemnly excommunicated the whole band; but
when they called for a volunteer to deliver copies of the resolutions
to Felizardo, none was forthcoming, even though they promised a
general&rsquo;s commission to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=
"#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>any man who undertook the task. But
they sent no force against the chief of the mountains, and, almost
before they had got half-way through their discussions on the subject
of dealing with him, the American Army arrived and, as the soldiers put
it, began to clear up the mess.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the Provisional Government itself had taken to
the hills; and many a time, when the Americans were hard on their
heels, members of that same government looked longingly at
Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains, and thought of the shelter to be obtained
there, or rather of the shelter which might have been obtained there,
had Felizardo not been a tyrant and an Enemy of the People. Yet none
even set foot in his territory, for that message of his concerning the
Law of the Bolo had been repeated faithfully in Manila; and all men, at
least all Filipinos, knew that Felizardo was a man of his word.</p>
<p>So the Americans chased the insurrectos&mdash;that is, the troops of
the late Provisional Government&mdash;and the ladrones, and the
head-hunters who were Felizardo&rsquo;s northern neighbours, gathered
in the stragglers on both sides, each doing in accordance with his
customs; but the mountains were left alone. Then, as all the world
knows, or ought to know, just as the army had the insurrectos nicely in
hand, and was about to capture, and hang comfortably, the worst
offenders, the exigencies of party <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51"
href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>politics in the United States
led to the institution of Civil Government throughout the Islands. The
army was withdrawn; the members of the late Provisional Government were
absolved of their murders and their rapes, and their other
abominations, and made governors of provinces, and commissioners, and
even judges; and from these the Civil Government first learned of
Felizardo and his wicked ways, how he had flogged, and even hanged,
pure Filipino patriots; and Mr Commissioner Furber, the head of the new
department of Constabulary and Trade&mdash;a rather infelicitous, or
invidious, combination&mdash;decided that Felizardo, the Enemy of the
People, must be rooted out and destroyed; for Mr Commissioner Furber,
like Mr Collector Sharler of the Customs, who had a native wife, was a
firm believer in that great and glorious and democratic doctrine, which
declared that the Filipino was the white man&rsquo;s Little Brown
Brother, whilst, obviously, this same Felizardo, whom the ex-generals
declared to be a common ladrone, had no fraternal feelings at all. So
the doom of Felizardo was signed and sealed, and the only thing
remaining to be done was the carrying out of the sentence&mdash;a small
matter surely when the latter had been pronounced by a Commissioner of
great power. It is at this point that Captain Basil Hayle of the
Philippines Constabulary, late Sergeant Hayle of the Garrison
Artillery, U.S.A., comes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>into the story; for he was the man
deputed to carry out the dread fiat of Mr Commissioner Furber, which
led to his going up into the mountains and learning the Law of the
Bolo.</p>
<p>Basil Hayle took his discharge from the Army in Manila at the
earliest possible opportunity. He was a little tired of garrison
gunnery as practised in the Islands, and was anxious to join one of the
new corps of native troops then being formed. The chance came quickly.
The Civil Government, desirous of proving to the Army how beautifully
it could manage without professional assistance, raised a force of its
own, the Philippines Constabulary, the rank and file of which was
composed of any stray natives who felt sufficiently energetic to
enlist, whilst the officers consisted mainly of discharged private
soldiers. The equipping of the Constabulary gave the politicians in the
Government offices the chance of their lives. The rifles were
Springfield carbines, manufactured in the early &lsquo;seventies; most
of the ammunition would not fire; whilst the clothing and boots were of
the very worst quality imaginable, purchased at the very best
prices.</p>
<p>It is one thing to raise officers for such a corps, quite another
thing to keep them. Basil Hayle, however, was amongst those who
remained, and, as a result, he quickly found himself promoted captain
of a company of some sixty surly, ragged little men, natives of Manila
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>and its immediate neighbourhood, who could neither
drill nor shoot, whose objects in life were to smoke cigarettes, play
monte, and, whenever the chance occurred, slip away to a cock-fight,
from which they generally returned penniless and incoherent.</p>
<p>Basil did his best with them. He contrived to be sent to an
out-station, in the hopes of getting them in hand; but the sole result
was that five joined a local band of ladrones, taking their carbines
and their friends&rsquo; money with them, whilst five more returned
hurriedly, and without leave, to Manila, to lay their grievances before
a fellow-countryman, an ex-colonel of the Army of Liberty, who was now
chief secretary to Mr Commissioner Furber. Meanwhile, Captain
Hayle&rsquo;s subaltern, a youth from Boston, had married a native
woman, a proceeding which aroused all Basil&rsquo;s bitterest Southern
prejudices. The incident moved him to speech, and he spoke with so much
emphasis, and so much effect, that from that time onwards he was short
of an officer. Then, to crown it all, a runner came in with peremptory
orders from the Commissioner for him to bring his company back to
Manila and explain his arbitrary proceedings.</p>
<p>This time, there was no one to whom he could speak emphatically,
save the messenger, who knew no English, whilst, so far, his own
knowledge of Spanish expletives was limited; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>consequently, he had to keep it all for the
Commissioner, who, having regarded him hitherto as a silent, docile
man, even if he were a Southerner&mdash;Furber himself came from
Boston&mdash;was distinctly surprised and pained, as Basil had intended
he should be. Still, in the end, they parted, if not good friends, at
least with a temporary understanding. So many useful officers had
resigned recently that the Commissioner dare not let another go;
moreover, he had just been made fully acquainted with the evil deeds of
Felizardo, that enemy of Progress and the Sovereign People; and Basil
Hayle seemed a very suitable man to go and rout out the nest of
brigands in the mountains.</p>
<p>Hayle accepted the commission joyfully, knowing nothing of
Felizardo, of whom he now heard for the first time. He was in the
service purely for the sake of excitement and experience, and this task
of clearing those mountains, which he had so often admired, of a gang
of brigands and murderers seemed to promise him both. That same night,
after dinner, he went to the Orpheum, the music-hall of Manila, and,
meeting Clancy of the <i>Manila Star</i> in the entrance, was taken
into the Press box, whence you can obtain the finest view of those
young ladies who are imported at vast expense, and apparently with only
part of their wardrobes, from Australia and the China Coast to elevate
and amuse the public of Manila. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55"
href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span></p>
<p>Clancy had known the Philippines in the Spanish days, and Basil
turned to him for information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever heard of a ladrone called Felizardo?&rdquo; he
asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;Clancy had a passion for correct
expressions&mdash;&ldquo;but I have heard of an old man called
Felizardo, who for the last five-and-twenty years has been recognised
by the Spaniards as the chief of that range of mountains over there. He
was an outlaw, certainly, but a regular ladrone, never. The Spaniards
were too wise to worry him, and he left them alone. Why, what&rsquo;s
the matter with him now? Has he been hanging any more
patriots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only I&rsquo;ve got to go out and catch him, and break up
his band.&rdquo; There was a note of defiance in Hayle&rsquo;s voice.
He was young, after all, a bare eight-and-twenty, and he did not like
even the possibility of ridicule.</p>
<p>But Clancy was very grave now. &ldquo;You are going up there?&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You, who are new at the game yourself, going up against
Felizardo, with that ragged crowd of yours? Why, man, it&rsquo;s
absurd. Twenty companies like yours wouldn&rsquo;t suffice for the job.
Your people must be stark raving mad&rdquo;&mdash;Clancy was an
Irishman. &ldquo;Take my advice and go sick. You&rsquo;ll be cut to
pieces the moment you set foot on Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>Basil got up stiffly. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I
shall not take your advice. I have been ordered to go, and I shall
go&mdash;to-morrow, if possible,&rdquo; and he went out.</p>
<p>Clancy looked after him, and shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;A fool
and his folly,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;or, rather, fools and their
folly. Still, it is a pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, Captain Hayle did not start for the mountains the following
day, nor for many days after. Incautiously, or perhaps fortunately, he
mentioned their destination to his serjeant, who repeated the news to
the men, with the result that there were only three members of the
company, the serjeant and two corporals, old soldiers of the Spanish
times, who answered to the roll-call that evening. The rest had found
urgent business elsewhere, and half of them had forgotten to leave
their carbines behind.</p>
<p>It was a very angry and shamed-faced Captain of Constabulary who
reported the occurrence to the Commissioner on the following morning;
but, greatly to his surprise, that official was almost sympathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot say I was altogether unprepared for it,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;In fact, since I saw you, I have heard so many absurd
stories concerning this Felizardo, who seems to be a kind of
supernatural person in the eyes of the common people here, that I can
understand your poor, ignorant soldiers going.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They took twenty-eight carbines,&rdquo; Hayle interjected
grimly.</p>
<p>The Commissioner smiled. &ldquo;My secretary assures me those will
be returned. There is no vice in those Little Brown Brothers of ours.
It is only men like this Felizardo who cause all the
trouble&#8202;&hellip;. Well, Captain Hayle, there is a company in
Manila now, one which was raised in the Island of Samar by Captain
Marten, who has just died. You had better take command of that. You
will find those Samar men are not afraid of Felizardo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Basil Hayle took over the sixty-five little brown men from Samar,
and spent the better part of a fortnight trying to instil some idea of
discipline into their heads; then, with infinite trouble, he managed to
get some tolerably reliable ammunition from the stores, and bought
boots for his men out of his own pocket, though he knew that the money
would be stolen. And after that he went back to the Commissioner, and
reported that he was ready, adding: &ldquo;It would be as well if one
of these Manila men, who gave you the information about Felizardo, came
along as guide.&rdquo; But all those same Manila men had, it appeared,
very pressing private business which they could not leave, and, anyway,
as the Commissioner said: &ldquo;If you search long enough, you are
bound to come on these outlaws;&rdquo; whereat, Captain Hayle went out,
shrugging his shoulders. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>had been making a few enquiries, from
Spaniards and other folk likely to know, and he had come to the
conclusion that it was far more probable that Felizardo would find him.
Still, Clancy of the <i>Star</i> had put him on his mettle, and he was
determined to go through with it.</p>
<p>At Igut, where the corporal of the Guardia <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e861" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span> had landed thirty years
before, there was a garrison consisting of a company of the Philippine
Scouts, a force which held itself to be vastly superior to the
Constabulary, for, though the rank and file of both were drawn from the
same classes, the Scouts were under the Army, and so had food and
clothing and high pay, and other advantages, which, if given to an
Asiatic, tend to make him proud and mutinous and careful of his own
skin. They had rebuilt Igut since the corporal&rsquo;s day, and there
was now a regular plaza with half a dozen stone-built houses on it, and
a gaol and barracks and many nipa-shacks and a church; in fact, there
was accommodation for all classes of the community, save the pigs, and
fowls, and pariah-dogs, which wandered at large, spreading disease.
Still, even with these drawbacks, it was an important place. The
Presidente was an ex-member of the Provisional Government, whom the
army was just going to hang for torturing a bugler to death, when the
Civil Government saved him; the principal merchant was a nephew of old
Don Jos&eacute; Ramirez of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>Calocan; whilst Captain Bush, the
officer in command of the Scouts, lived with his wife in the large
white-washed house at the top corner of the plaza. Igut had changed
greatly since the day when Felizardo had the heads of the ladrones
stuck on posts along the beach, and insisted on the corporal having the
credit for the victory.</p>
<p>A wheezy little steamer took Captain Hayle and his men across the
bay. At first, the skipper suggested that he should land the party at
Igut; but, greatly to his disgust, Hayle declined. There was another
tiny harbour practically at the foot of the mountains, and there was no
sense in tramping ten miles or so through the jungle when you could go
much more comfortably by water. It was nothing to Basil if the mestizo
skipper happened to be in a hurry to get back in time for a big
cock-fight. So, in the end, they disembarked at the village of Katubig,
which consisted of a score of nipa-shacks along the edge of the beach,
the sort of place which could be burned with the greatest ease any
night, if you were not on good terms with the ladrones&mdash;or, more
important still, not under the protection of Felizardo&mdash;facts
which struck Captain Hayle at once, and made him very careful and a
little anxious.</p>
<p>Felizardo had received ample warning of the coming of the
Constabulary; in fact, ten of the deserters from Hayle&rsquo;s old
company had arrived, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span>with their carbines, and begged to be
admitted to the band; but, though the chief had retained the weapons,
which would be useful, he had declined the services of the men, arguing
that if they had been unfaithful to the Americanos, they would possibly
be unfaithful to him.</p>
<p>He was perfectly able to hold his own in the mountains, of that he
had no doubt; but still Hayle&rsquo;s expedition worried him, because
it showed that the Americanos did not mean to continue the sensible
Spanish policy of leaving him alone. For years past he had given up
active ladronism, having no further need to practise anything of the
kind, and he was both annoyed and astonished that the new authorities
in Manila should think of interfering with him. It never occurred to
him that, in addition to having incurred the enmity of the Manila
mestizos, he was also an anachronism&mdash;that he represented a
condition of affairs which Mr Commissioner Furber and his colleagues
could not allow to continue, that his personal independence was
contrary to all the accepted theories of law and order, as well as to
the Declaration of Independence, because, as the Commissioners had
heard on the very best authority, he was a tyrant and an Enemy of the
People.</p>
<p>If Felizardo had understood these things, he might have acted
differently, and have made his peace with Manila. True, he was growing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>old, and a little weary, and old men are less
ready for strife than are the younger ones; but, at the same time, they
are less ready to change their points of view, and the one fixed idea
in Felizardo&rsquo;s mind was that the mountains belonged to him.
Still, he did not want to bring on a crisis; and so he sent word to his
outposts on the lower slopes, to the villages in the valley, and to the
head-hunters on the northern side, that the Americanos were to be
turned back with as little bloodshed as possible&mdash;which was
fortunate for Captain Basil Hayle and his men.</p>
<p>The Constabulary remained one night at Katubig, the Teniente of
which proved to be a most courteous old native, very full of
information concerning Felizardo and his evil ways; in fact, so anxious
was he to see the band broken up, that he even offered to let his own
servant guide Hayle and his men to the brigands&rsquo; camp, which, he
said, was some twenty miles away, towards the end of the range. For a
moment, Basil hesitated. It seemed a little too easy. Then he
recollected that his only alternative was to blunder forward without a
guide of any sort, and so he accepted the offer.</p>
<p>Twenty miles may not seem a great distance in a civilised country,
where there are roads, or, at least, paths; but twenty miles along the
lower slopes of Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains, forcing one&rsquo;s way
through the dense jungle, with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>necessity of being prepared for
attack at any moment, is a very different matter. It took two days to
do the journey, and when the column arrived, weary and hungry, at the
spur of the big volcano, just beyond which Felizardo&rsquo;s camp was
supposed to be, and camped down for the night, Basil discovered that
the guide had slipped away into the bush.</p>
<p>The situation was not a pleasant one. The whole way they had seen no
trace either of ladrones or of tao. There was no chance of getting
another guide, no chance of obtaining information; whilst for lack of
cargadores, or carriers, they had only been able to take five
days&rsquo; food supply with them. In the circumstances, most men would
have made their way straight back to Katubig, and then have started
afresh; but the idea was utterly repugnant to Captain Hayle. He felt
that, so far, he had shown himself a helpless amateur, and that to
return meekly would be to make a public confession of failure. He spent
half the night sitting beside the fire, smoking, and trying to think
out a plan. He realised now the extreme difficulty of his task, the
absurdity of it even&mdash;they had set a white man who had not the
slightest idea of the geography of the range to track down a native
outlaw who had spent thirty-five years there, and knew every inch of
the ground.</p>
<p>Nine Constabulary officers out of ten would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>have
reported the job to be hopeless. Basil Hayle happened to be the tenth
man, and, before he lay down to sleep, he had decided to do the thing
scientifically&mdash;to explore the range from end to end, even if he
took months over doing it, and then to ask for an adequate force with
which to round up the outlaws. It was the only way.</p>
<p>In accordance with this plan, he did the one thing which neither
Felizardo, nor any one else, would have expected him to do&mdash;at the
first streak of dawn he started to climb straight up the mountain-side,
beyond the jungle, beyond the scrub which succeeded the jungle, on to
the rocky ground itself, and there he had his first fight.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Felizardo hanged two of the survivors for not keeping a
proper lookout; but, though that prevented similar mishaps for the
future, it did not alter the essential fact that the outlaws were badly
beaten. They had a camp&mdash;it was one of their largest outpost
stations&mdash;on a great ledge of rock, from which, on a clear day,
you could see Manila itself. Two large caves furnished the main
shelter, but in addition to these there were half a dozen little huts,
amongst which the men were sitting, smoking and playing cards, when
Basil Hayle and his men suddenly appeared. For once, the rifle had its
chance against the bolo, or rather the bolo had no chance at all.
Moreover, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>Constabulary were superior numerically. The first
volley really settled the question; and when a dozen bolomen did rally
and attempt a rush, half-heartedly, knowing that the bolo should be
used in the jungle or in the darkness, they were beaten back
easily.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, everything was over; and then Basil Hayle made a
discovery which was to alter the whole of his after-life. There were
half a dozen women and children in one of the caves, weeping and
clinging to one another. Basil drew back hurriedly. He did not like to
see things like that, especially as most of them were young, and one, a
mestiza, was extremely nice-looking. The position was rather awkward,
he told himself. He had not the slightest intention of taking them
along with him, and yet, if he left them up there, on that ledge of
rock, with three or four badly wounded outlaws as their sole guard, no
one could tell what might happen. Possibly, Felizardo&rsquo;s main camp
was twenty miles away, and, from what he had heard of the old
man&rsquo;s character, it was quite likely that none of the few members
of the outpost who had escaped unhurt would be in a hurry to return to
their leader.</p>
<p>Basil pushed his hat back and scratched his head. What right had
women to be mixed up in an affair like this? Then, suddenly, his eyes
fell on the only unwounded prisoner, a sullen-looking youth, who had
been knocked down <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span>with the butt-end of a carbine. &ldquo;Come
here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you know Felizardo&rsquo;s
camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked at him suspiciously; then Basil went on: &ldquo;Go
and tell him to come and fetch these women and the wounded men. See?
Get along now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He needed no second bidding. He had been expecting to be taken down
to the coast and hanged as a ladrone, and he did not feel quite sure
that such was not to be his fate until he was actually out of sight
round the next spur of the mountain; then he doubled back, and
re-passed the Constabulary out of sight, for, like a true outlaw, he
had taken the precaution of starting off in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Had Basil Hayle been a more experienced, or a less chivalrous man,
he would have waited, on the chance of Felizardo himself coming along
presently, in which case this story would have ended abruptly, so far
as the Constabulary officer was concerned; for the force which
presently arrived, expecting some such trap, had both rifles and bolos,
and crept in cautiously from all sides; but, by that time, the
Constabulary were miles away, scrambling over the rocks in great
good-humour, for had they not won their first fight, and acquired, not
only glory, but loot as well in the form of bolos, and playing cards,
and clothes, and, most important of all, cigarettes?</p>
<p>The Captain, too, was satisfied, feeling he had made a good start.
Moreover, he had secured <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>an additional two days&rsquo;
provisions, and so would be able to explore the whole of one side of
the range before returning to Katubig.</p>
<p>The Teniente of Katubig was very apologetic about the guide. It was
all a mistake, he said. The man had taken them to the foot of the wrong
volcano, and then, fearing to be punished, had fled. Still, every one
was glad to hear that the Senor Capitaine had inflicted a severe blow
on that villain, Felizardo, who would doubtless now see the wisdom of
submission to those great-hearted Americanos, who had saved the Islands
from the oppressions of both the Spaniards and the insurrectos. As for
the ladrones&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Basil cut his eloquence short. &ldquo;How did you hear about our
fight?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>For an instant the Teniente looked troubled, then he laughed.
&ldquo;I forgot. There is one here, a young tao by his appearance, who
has been waiting for three days past with a letter for you. He it was
who had heard of the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hayle frowned. &ldquo;Send him in to me,&rdquo; he said. The moment
the messenger entered, the American knew him again; but the Teniente,
who was watching closely, detected no sign of recognition; nor did
Basil&rsquo;s face give him any clue to the contents of the letter,
which ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Felizardo thanks the American captain for
returning to him his daughter, and the other women, and also the
wounded men. That is how brave men make war; and if at any time
Felizardo has the opportunity of doing a similar <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>service,
assuredly it will be performed. On the other hand, in the mountains,
which belong to Felizardo, there is only one law, the Law of the Bolo,
and those who come as enemies will be met with the bolo. This was the
word Felizardo sent to the insurrectos, and he sends the same message
to the Americanos. Though, perhaps, some day he may be able to show the
captain of the Samar men that he can be an enemy and a friend at the
same time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Captain Basil Hayle folded the letter carefully, and thrust it into
an inner pocket. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;Felizardo&rsquo;s own daughter&mdash;the well-dressed, pretty
mestiza, I suppose. I don&rsquo;t think I shall mention this to
Furber&mdash;or to any one else, for that matter, as they
wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h2 class="main">HOW MRS BUSH HEARD OF THE LAW OF THE BOLO</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After he received the letter from Felizardo, thanking
him for returning his daughter, promising to repay the service when an
opportunity occurred, and threatening him with the Law of the Bolo if
he dared to come, as an American officer, on to his mountains, Captain
Basil Hayle spent three days in Katubig, resting his men, and preparing
to do the very thing which Felizardo had forbidden. His duty was to
destroy the community of outlaws in the mountains; yet, though at the
first encounter he had scored an easy victory, he was by no means sure
that he could repeat the process. It is one thing for troops armed with
carbines to surprise bolomen in the open, quite another thing when the
bolomen jump out on the troops in the dense jungle, where you hardly
have time to bring your carbine to your shoulder once, much less have
time to reload, before they are right on you, slashing and jabbing with
their hateful knives, under cover of the smoke. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>So far, Basil Hayle had had practically no experience of jungle
fighting, but he had a very shrewd notion of what it would be like;
and, whilst his little Constabulary soldiers were full of confidence
and ardour, as a result of their first victory, he looked forward with
a certain amount of misgiving, not because he was afraid&mdash;he was
physically incapable of fear&mdash;but because, having started the
hunting of Felizardo, he was anxious to see the job through to the
end.</p>
<p>He heard a good deal of Felizardo during those three days; for on
the night of his return a curious little tramp steamer wheezed into the
bay, and put ashore an equally curious old Spaniard, a hemp-buyer; and
from him Basil Hayle learned many things; for the newcomer had known
Don Jos&eacute; Ramirez and the corporal of the Guardia <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e943" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span>, and could
remember the building of what was then the new gallows at Calocan, on
which they had hanged Cinicio Dagujob the ladrone thirty-five years
before. Consequently, he was able to tell Basil, who was only too ready
to hear, all about how Felizardo had slain Pablo the priest, and had
run off with Dolores Lasara, and had taken to the mountains, of which
he was now the ruler.</p>
<p>Basil Hayle asked many questions, and with each answer he grew to
have more respect for the power of the wizened little man whom he was
to hunt down&mdash;if he could. Of Dolores <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>Lasara
the Spaniard could tell him little. &ldquo;I saw her once, and&mdash;I
was very young then, younger than you are now&mdash;I thought her the
most beautiful mestiza in the Islands. Perhaps she was; at any rate,
many men have died because Felizardo loved her so well. She is still
alive, they say; and I hear there is a daughter.&rdquo; Basil coloured
involuntarily. &ldquo;How do I hear all these things? Oh, now that they
no longer have reason to fear us, we Spaniards can go anywhere, just as
the English have always done. The Law of the Bolo is for other
Filipinos, and for you Americanos&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed
gently&mdash;&ldquo;you will learn that law by and by. So far, you have
hardly begun to know it. If we had taken those insurrectos, those
generals and colonels and majors, we should have hanged them, and
finished all the foolishness. You create them judges and governors, and
make it worse. This same Felizardo knows better than that, even though
he may have been born a tao and have killed a priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as the Constabulary were starting out on the fourth morning,
the old Spaniard gave their officer one last word of advice. &ldquo;I
say you are mad to go on Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains at all&mdash;what
harm does the old man do to your American politicians in
Manila?&mdash;but you will be more than mad if you go round on the
northern slopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Hayle demanded. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Spaniard smiled. &ldquo;Head-hunters&mdash;hundreds of them they
say, more dangerous than any bolomen. I have never been there to see.
No, Senor; but I have heard often. What are they, Senor? How much you
Americanos have to learn about these Islands! Why, just
savages&mdash;quite different from the Filipinos&mdash;nearly naked.
Their pleasure in life is to collect heads, just as your great men
collect millions of dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pleasant notion!&rdquo; Hayle&rsquo;s voice was quite
cheerful. &ldquo;No, Senor, I am not going the head-hunters&rsquo;
direction this time; but I may do so soon. Still, if I do, I shall come
back to tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head rather sadly as he walked away.
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;perhaps&mdash;but first old
Felizardo, then the head-hunters, and only sixty half-trained Samar tao
as his troops. They are rash, very rash, these young Americans. A nice
lad, too.&rdquo; He sighed heavily, and went back to the weighing of
his hemp.</p>
<p>Captain Hayle had decided to explore the seaward end of the range,
where the mountains ran almost down to the shore of the great bay;
consequently, from Katubig he followed the coast until he came to what
looked like a suitable place for beginning his climb. Up to that point,
he had not seen a sign of any human being, not heard a sound, save that
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>waves breaking on the shore, and the wind
murmuring through the cocoa-nut palms; but no sooner had he started to
force his way into the jungle on the lower slopes, than a deep note
boomed out, apparently from the tree-tops a few hundred yards away; a
moment later, it was repeated, higher up the hill, and then again and
yet again, in a dozen places, until every native for miles round must
have heard it.</p>
<p>Basil stopped abruptly. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he demanded of
his serjeant.</p>
<p>The man made an expressive gesture. &ldquo;The Boudjon, Senor, the
alarm-horn. Now, every one of these ladrones knows we are coming.
Either we shall see none at all, or we shall see too many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil muttered an oath, then, &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The quicker we move, the better our chances;&rdquo; but already
his own hopes of another successful fight had vanished. Obviously,
Felizardo&rsquo;s men were not to be caught asleep a second time.</p>
<p>It had been raining all night, and as a result the slope, bad enough
at any time by reason of its horrible steepness, was now trebly bad on
account of the slippery red clay underfoot. There was no trail of any
sort; it was just a matter of forcing one&rsquo;s way through the
dense, soaking undergrowth, of fighting one&rsquo;s way upwards,
half-blinded with perspiration all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73"
href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>the time, of dragging
one&rsquo;s boots, which now seemed to weigh a hundred pounds each, out
of that horrible mire at every step, and then sliding back half the
distance one had advanced. It was impossible to keep in any sort of
order so as to be ready to meet an attack. There were always
stragglers, those who got tangled up in the vines, or had their boots
wrenched off by the mud. Basil Hayle went ahead, and trusted that his
men, who were born to the jungle, were keeping up with him, for at no
time could he actually see them all, on account of the dense bush.</p>
<p>They had gone, perhaps, half a mile up the hillside when he was
suddenly convinced that men were watching him, that in the jungle
ahead, and on both sides too, there were bolomen closing in. He paused
and looked round, and saw nothing; looked round again and caught a
glimpse of something white behind a bush. At the same moment, the
serjeant, who was just behind him, saw it too, and gave a shout. The
Constabulary tried to close up, but the last man was a full hundred
yards behind, down the slope, and it was too late. The bolomen broke
cover&mdash;a couple of hundred of them at least&mdash;whilst the
Constabulary were still a helpless rabble, and the ragged volley which
the plucky little Samar men let off only made matters worse. Possibly,
it injured some of the trees and bushes; certainly, one bullet did get
a boloman square <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>in the throat; but under cover of the smoke, which
hung like a pall in that breathless atmosphere, the outlaws rushed
in.</p>
<p>The Constabulary died game. They were from Samar, Visayans by race,
and the outlaws were natives of Luzon, Tagalogs; and between Visayan
and Tagalog there is a never-dying blood-feud. Those who had bolos
dropped their carbines, and set to work in their national fashion;
those who had no bolos clubbed their carbines, and did their best that
way. All died standing up, and almost every Visayan killed or wounded a
Tagalog before he himself went down. They upheld the honour of Samar
that day on the slopes of Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains, when the Tagalog
outlaws were three to one, and had the additional advantage of
surprising a winded column.</p>
<p>Basil found himself with a little group of some fifteen men. The
bolomen were in between him and the rest of his party, and so thick was
the smoke&mdash;for, despite his orders, those round him continued to
blaze away wildly&mdash;that he could see nothing of what was occurring
below. Only, knowing that the outlaws were in overwhelming force, and
hearing no more shots from the rest of his column, he could guess with
a fair degree of certainty.</p>
<p>There were no bolomen above him now, so far as he could make out,
and when at last the smoke cleared away, he could see none on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>the slope below. Nor could he see any of his other
men, at least until he went down to look for them. Then he found them,
and every one he saw was dead, usually with a dead outlaw somewhere
near him.</p>
<p>He did not stay to count the bodies; he did not even go through what
would have been the perfectly useless formality of ascertaining if any
were still alive. For some inexplicable reason the outlaws had
disappeared&mdash;they had not even made an attempt against him and his
own little group&mdash;but they might be back at any moment, and his
first duty was to get his pitiful handful of survivors into a place of
safety.</p>
<p>As they hurried down the hillside, Basil blamed himself savagely for
his folly. He had gone on blindly, in face of the warning of the
alarm-horn, in face of Felizardo&rsquo;s warning, taking his brave
little fellows to certain death; and then, in the end, he had escaped
without even one single boloman having attempted his life. Moreover, he
had remained where he was, whilst his men were being cut to pieces
below him. At first, this latter thought was the most bitter of all;
then suddenly he understood, with a great sense of
relief&mdash;Felizardo had ordered his life to be spared, and if he had
led those last fifteen through the smoke they, too, would have been
sacrificed uselessly. Still, it was galling to feel you owed your life
to the clemency of an old outlaw, whom you had been sent out to catch.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>He wondered what they would say in Manila. They would get his first
message, telling how he had surprised the outpost on the slope of the
volcano; and now he would have to send a second message&mdash;a message
of a very different character&mdash;reporting that he had lost fifty
men and fifty carbines, that the outlaws had scored a victory, the news
of which would carry hope and encouragement to the hearts of all the
criminal and all the disloyal elements in the Islands.</p>
<p>He wondered too what his men would think of him. They were keeping
very close at his heels, expecting another attack any moment. He
glanced back over his shoulder, half-fearing to meet with scornful or
reproachful looks; but they were loyal little fellows, being simple
tao, and, in their half-savage way, they were very sorry for him. The
serjeant, a grizzled veteran who had received his first training at
Calocan, under the successor of the old corporal of the Guardia
<span class="corr" id="xd25e998" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span>,
tried to comfort him. &ldquo;It is Fate, Senor. Why worry? Last time we
had the luck; to-day the luck is with those accursed ladrones.
Doubtless, next time we shall have our chance again. We could not help
it. If we had charged, instead of keeping where we were, they would
have had us too, and there would have been none to avenge our comrades.
They were three to one all the time; and they were fresh, whilst we
were exhausted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>with the climbing and the mud. It was their day
to-day, Senor; to-morrow, it will be ours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little men following behind grunted approval, which eased
Basil&rsquo;s mind considerably, knowing, as he did, that they were
reliable judges.</p>
<p>They saw no trace of the outlaws as they made their way down to the
beach, though three of the men whom they had reckoned dead, scrambled
through the jungle to rejoin them. Basil breathed more freely when he
found himself back in the cocoa-nut grove, off Felizardo&rsquo;s
ground, where, at least, one had a chance to shoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will get to Katubig as quickly as possible,&rdquo; he said
to the serjeant. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they will follow us there;
but, even if they do, we can put up a fight in one of the
houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later, however, he began to think his confidence had
not been justified; for one of the men, happening to look back, caught
sight of a figure moving along the edge of the jungle, where the bush
ended and the cocoa-nut grove began, and then they caught fleeting
glimpses of many, though all the time there was nothing at which to
shoot.</p>
<p>Basil did the right thing. He led his men on to the beach itself,
where the boloman has to come within range of the carbines long before
he reaches you, and there is always sufficient breeze to clear away the
smoke. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>They marched quickly, or rather they hurried along&mdash;as Basil
Hayle told himself bitterly, they were the remnant of a defeated force
in full retreat&mdash;and all the time they were aware that the bolomen
were following just at the edge of the jungle; then, suddenly, they
rounded the point by Katubig, when you come in sight of the village,
and for a moment they forgot even the bolomen, for Katubig was in
flames. Half the nipa and bamboo houses, including that in which the
Constabulary supplies were stored, had already collapsed, whilst
another five minutes would see the rest practically gutted.</p>
<p>Captain Hayle groaned. &ldquo;Well, of all the infernal
luck&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began; then he noticed that there was not
a single native in sight, not a single canoe left on the beach, and
straightway he understood. Katubig was practically one of
Felizardo&rsquo;s villages&mdash;he was a fool not to have thought of
that before&mdash;and the old chief no longer intended it to be used as
a base for operations against himself.</p>
<p>There was practically only one course open to Basil, and he decided
instantly to take it. He had no axes, no tools of any sort;
consequently, there was no possibility of making anything in the way of
a stockade, whilst to remain in the open with only eighteen men was to
invite a further and final disaster. No, he must cover the ten or
twelve miles to Igut, where there was a company of the Philippine
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>Scouts quartered. There he would be safe, and from
there he could send a report of his defeat to Manila. It was not a
pleasant prospect. The Constabulary and the Scouts did not love one
another overmuch, and it was humiliating to have to seek refuge with
the rival force. Still, he could see no alternative. Even as he
decided, he could catch glimpses of Felizardo&rsquo;s bolomen in the
background, dodging from bush to bush, never giving a chance for a
shot, but still driving him back from Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains. He
glanced at the sun. It was about one o&rsquo;clock&mdash;Heavens, how
much seemed to have happened since sunrise!&mdash;if he went straight
on, and there was no sense in going into the burning village itself, he
would be at Igut by sunset, provided the path were not unusually
bad.</p>
<p>The men heaved sighs of relief when they learned their destination.
They had had enough of the mountains to last them for a day or two; it
was going to pour with rain again that night; and the prospect of
sleeping, or rather of trying to sleep, in the open with
Felizardo&rsquo;s bolomen prowling round, just outside the circle of
firelight, was not an exhilarating one. Consequently, they started off
for Igut very cheerfully. True, they had lost most of their comrades,
and had been badly beaten by the accursed Tagalog outlaws; but, after
all, what matter? They themselves were all right. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>They had
plenty of cigarettes for the march: they could buy plenty more in Igut,
in addition to spirits; whilst, doubtless, the Scouts would have money
to lose at monte; moreover, next time they met Felizardo&rsquo;s men,
the fight would go the other way&mdash;of that they felt
sure&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Somehow, Igut seemed well-named. The word might mean anything, but
the sound expressed the town itself, at least to Western ears. The
place might appear picturesque, almost fascinating, to a chance
visitor, who knew that he was going to leave it in a few hours; but
when you had to live there, you quickly came to see it in a very
different light, as Mrs Bush, the wife of Captain Bush of the
Philippine Scouts, who had not been out of it for a whole year, could
have told you.</p>
<p>From the balcony of her house at the corner of the plaza, Mrs Bush
could survey the whole scene; and, as time hung very heavily on her
hands, she used to spend many an hour lying back in her long bamboo
chair, watching the view with languid disfavour, striving hard not to
resent the fate which had led her to bury her bright young life in such
a spot.</p>
<p>There was so little worth looking at, when you got to know it. The
same tao were always asleep under the shade of the huge timber belfry
in the middle of the plaza, the same hungry dogs were always nosing
round for stray pieces of offal, the same shrill-voiced women
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>wrangling with the Chinaman who kept the general
store at the far corner. The priest would come out at a certain hour,
meet the Presidente, and they would then make their way together to the
spirit shop next to the Chinaman&rsquo;s. A little later, the
Supervisor and the school teacher&mdash;white officials
these&mdash;would come round the corner and follow the others to the
same place, where presently her own husband would join them. Then, just
at sundown, a squad of Scouts would loaf across the plaza to perform
what they called mounting guard at the gaol. With that, the day&rsquo;s
activities would end, and the long, sweltering, breathless night, when
the mosquitoes and the heat, and perhaps, as in her case, your own
mental torment, would not allow you an hour&rsquo;s real sleep. On
Sundays the only difference was that every small boy in the place was
allowed to jangle those terrible bells in the plaza to his
heart&rsquo;s content, and the white officials went to the spirit shop
earlier in the day.</p>
<p>So much for the town. If you looked seawards&mdash;and from that
balcony you had an almost uninterrupted view&mdash;it was equally
monotonous. The palm-fringed bay, with its multicoloured coral bottom,
and the vast expanses of mangrove swamp, which, almost closing its
entrance, rendered it a safe anchorage, even when the monsoon was
booming in its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>fiercest, always seemed the same. True, every now
and then, at irregular intervals, a Government launch would come in
with mails or stores. More rarely still, a trading steamer, with
rust-streaked funnel and sides, a veritable maritime curiosity which
would have been condemned to the scrap-heap anywhere else, would wheeze
and cough her way up to the rickety wooden jetty in quest of a cargo of
hemp; but save on these occasions, the waters were disturbed only by
the dug-outs of native fishermen, who seemed to put to sea merely for
the sake of avoiding the flies on shore; at any rate, they always dozed
off to sleep the moment they had dropped the stones which served as
anchors.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush knew it all so well, and hated it as well as she knew it.
Over a year ago&mdash;twelve months and three weeks, to be
correct&mdash;she had left Manila; and, though the capital was only a
few hours&rsquo; steam away, she had never been back, never spoken to a
woman of her own race&mdash;for her husband had been told pointedly by
the general in command that his only chance of retaining his commission
was to remain at his station, and get his men in hand again. Captain
Bush had left the capital, raging, and stayed at Igut, sulking; whilst
his wife had been too proud to suggest a trip for herself, and he had
been too indifferent to all that concerned her to offer it.</p>
<p>There was not even male society, for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>Treasurer, the Supervisor, and the two school
teachers, mere political nominees of small mental attainments, had long
since sunk to the point of mixing socially with the natives, a thing
from which her Southern blood recoiled in horror. Once, and once only,
had she turned on her husband, and that was on the occasion when he
brought the Supervisor and the Presidente&mdash;the latter a
mestizo&mdash;in to dinner. The experiment was never repeated; possibly
because Bush was really frightened at the storm he had aroused,
possibly because she frightened the guests themselves; though in the
end the latter had their revenge, or what passed with them as revenge,
by vilifying her on every possible occasion, and rendering the breach
between her and her husband absolutely uncrossable.</p>
<p>On the day of Basil Hayle&rsquo;s defeat on the mountain-side, Igut
had been panting and perspiring as only towns amongst the mangrove
swamps can perspire and pant. On the plaza nothing had stirred. The
women in the Chinaman&rsquo;s store had quickly grown weary of
wrangling, and had settled down to sleep in the doorway; even the dogs
and the wolfish-looking pigs had ceased to quarrel amongst themselves
on the quayside.</p>
<p>Evening brought little or no relief. Every few minutes, Mrs Bush
glanced towards the setting sun, longing for it to disappear behind
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>the line of mangroves, when there might be some
chance of a slight breeze.</p>
<p>She was, as usual, on the veranda, behind the light matting blind,
when an unwonted commotion made her start up quickly. The dogs had
awakened to fresh life, and were barking noisily. A native, who had
spread his net across the roadway that morning, with the intention of
repairing it, and had then gone to sleep over his task, came to his
senses suddenly, and began to gather in his property, as a small party
of native soldiers, headed by a white officer, swung down the street.
Mrs Bush lay back in her chair, and watched through the blind with
languid interest. There was something in the manner of the officer
which she liked. He seemed to know his own mind, and when half a dozen
natives gathered in his path, apparently with the object of making the
white man give way to them, and so raising a snigger at his expense, he
brushed them aside like so many flies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is from the South,&rdquo; she said to herself, and, almost
unconsciously, came to the rail of the balcony in order to see more
easily.</p>
<p>As soon as he reached the dusty patch of grass in the centre of the
plaza, Captain Hayle dismissed his men, who, after piling their arms
against the timbers of the belfry, threw themselves down on the ground
and produced the inevitable cigarettes. From the barracks at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>the upper end of the plaza, a score of Scouts
emerged, and regarded the newcomers with marked disfavour, commenting
on their torn, mud-stained uniforms, and their generally-ragged
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only dam&rsquo; Constabularios,&rdquo; sneered a serjeant,
who prided himself on his knowledge of English; but, despite the
insults, Hayle&rsquo;s men smoked on unconcernedly. Had they not great
things to relate when the women came round; whilst these Scouts, mere
Tagalogs after all, had never even set foot on Felizardo&rsquo;s
mountains.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush remained at the rail of the balcony. The evening breeze had
just begun to blow, and, moreover, she felt vaguely that she would like
to get a nearer view of the newly-arrived white man. A minute later,
her wish was gratified, for, after asking a question of one of the
Scouts, who came forward rather sullenly, Basil Hayle started to cross
the plaza towards her house. He was a little weary, his walk showed
that; but when he chanced to look up and their eyes met, he seemed to
pull himself together; then, probably because he had not expected to
see a white woman in Igut, he raised his well-worn felt hat.</p>
<p>At the door, Basil found a sleepy muchacho, who, in reply to his
questions, answered that Captain Bush was out, adding gratuitously,
&ldquo;As usual.&rdquo; Nor did he know where the Scout officer was, or
when he would be in. He was not at the barracks, nor at the spirit
store across <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>the plaza. Still, the Senora might know; he would
call her.</p>
<p>From the glimpse he had obtained of her, Hayle had formed the
impression that Mrs Bush was pretty. When she came in, he saw that he
had been mistaken, if one judged by recognised codes, as no sane man
does judge, either of faces or of character, or&mdash;I say it even
with the fear of the Outer Darkness of the Podsnaps before me&mdash;of
morals. There are no rules in these matters, there can be no rules when
you are dealing with such infinitely complex subjects as human form and
human character. What is beauty in one woman is mere drabness in
another, for beauty is three parts soul and one part form to any one
but an animal-man, and animal-men should not count for
anything&mdash;in fact they should be eliminated whenever possible. The
same applies to morals. How can you lay down hard and fast rules when
the Magdalen is a Christian saint, and whilst those who revere her as
such, and dedicate churches to her, fall over themselves in their
anxiety to cast the first stone at her latter-day successors? But this
is all beside the scope of this story, which deals with the crude code
of the Bolo, the law with one clause only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I kept you,&rdquo; Mrs Bush said, with a soft
Southern drawl. &ldquo;But I get so few visitors I am never ready to
receive them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil flushed. &ldquo;I only came to see Captain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>Bush on
business. It wasn&rsquo;t fair to worry you. I wanted to get him to
lend me some food and kit for my men&mdash;Felizardo&rsquo;s people
burnt all theirs to-day&mdash;and I was going to ask him about sending
a dispatch into Manila. The boy said you would know where to find
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bush&rsquo;s face hardened momentarily, and she looked away
quickly, then, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
where&mdash;at least, I mean you cannot find him now. But, if you
don&rsquo;t mind waiting, he is sure to be in soon. Perhaps you would
like to come up on the balcony; it is cooler there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had sat down, Basil laughed rather awkwardly. &ldquo;I
forgot to tell you my name; it is Hayle&mdash;Basil Hayle of the
Constabulary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bush nodded. &ldquo;I guessed that, when you mentioned
Felizardo. We heard something of your fight up on the volcano, from an
old Spaniard who came in to-day; but he said you had gone back
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed bitterly, and glanced down at his torn and
mud-stained uniform. &ldquo;So I did, but I have come back
quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with ready sympathy. &ldquo;Do you mean they drove
you back? What hard luck, after starting so well! But did you go with
just that handful of men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bush was sorry she had asked the question as soon as she saw the
look in his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>eyes. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I went
out with sixty-five men this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the others?&rdquo; She leaned forward anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The others are there still,&rdquo; he replied, with a catch
in his voice. &ldquo;The bolomen were three to one, and they got us on
a muddy hillside, you understand.&rdquo; He was looking away, so he did
not see the pity in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the wounded?&rdquo; she asked gently.</p>
<p>Still, he did not face her. &ldquo;Felizardo leaves no
wounded.&rdquo; Then, suddenly, his pent-up feelings broke out, as was
inevitable they would do when he met one of his own race, one to whom
he could speak freely. &ldquo;Oh, I feel such a hound for leaving them.
I was at the head of the column, and the bolomen cut us off from the
rest; and whilst we, a dozen men and myself, were waiting for it to
come, they were boloing the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then? Then they just disappeared into the jungle, and we came
back, unharmed. They followed us almost to here, and they burned our
stores at Katubig&mdash;they burned Katubig itself in fact, but they
never tried to touch us. That&rsquo;s what makes me feel so bad. To
think they wiped out three-quarters of my men, and then let the rest of
us go. They&mdash;other men, I mean&mdash;are sure to say we ran at the
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bush shook her head. &ldquo;I hardly think <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>so. They
will say you were splendidly brave to go up at all, and splendidly
clever to get any of your men safely out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil thanked her with his eyes; but still he was not comforted.
&ldquo;It looks bad,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t
explain. They wouldn&rsquo;t believe the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the reason?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Tell me. I
shall believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He faced her now, fairly; and from that moment there was a new
factor, the All-important Factor, something infinitely greater than the
Law of the Bolo, in his life. In a flash, he understood how it was that
Felizardo had been ready to take to the hills for the sake of Dolores
Lasara. Then he told her of Felizardo&rsquo;s daughter, and of
Felizardo&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I believe,&rdquo; she said, when he had finished.
&ldquo;It is just what one would expect of Felizardo&#8202;&hellip;.
Oh, we hear a great deal about him here, from the servants. No, Captain
Hayle, you must not worry, really you must not. I know it is horrible,
to lose your men in that way; but you had to obey orders. Ninety-nine
men out of a hundred would have made an excuse for not going; but you
are different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer her this time, but sat, staring out across the
plaza, thinking of his men, away there on Felizardo&rsquo;s
mountain-side; at last her voice recalled him. &ldquo;You are from the
South, Captain Hayle?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href=
"#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>He clutched eagerly at the chance of changing the subject
completely; and from then, until her husband appeared, there was no
more mention of bolomen and their doings.</p>
<p>Captain Bush proved to be a big man, as tall as Hayle himself,
though much heavier&mdash;flabby, most people would have
said&mdash;good-looking in a way, though his eye was watery and his
chin weak. You could see at a glance why they had transferred him from
the Regular Infantry to the Scouts, and sent him to an out-station.
They do not like heavy drinkers in the American Service, any more than
they like amateur soldiers, or brigadier-generals appointed from the
circle of the President&rsquo;s personal friends.</p>
<p>Captain Bush had already heard something of Hayle&rsquo;s defeat,
though he did not explain how or where. Basil, on his part, did not
trouble to go into the story very fully. He had taken an immediate
dislike to Bush, and he felt that the latter was by no means grieved
over the disaster which had befallen the rival force. Still, the Scout
officer agreed readily enough to let him have the stores he needed, and
to allow the remnant of the Constabulary to occupy some vacant quarters
in the barracks. As soon as this was arranged, Hayle rose to leave, but
Mrs Bush detained him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Captain Hayle, you must stay to dinner now. Mustn&rsquo;t
he, John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bush nodded assent, but Basil looked down <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>at his
dirty, torn uniform. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can,
really&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began; but his hostess cut him
short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say they have burned all your kit, so how can you help
that? And, after all, one gets used to things in the Philippines. Where
are you going to stay in Igut? I wish we could put you up, but
I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s quite impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Spaniard here I know,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Don Juan Ramirez. I promised I would stay with him, if I ever
came to Igut, and I sent one of my men to tell him as soon as I got in.
I really ought to go there now, but, still, he will forgive me, I
expect, when I tell him that you insisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bush nodded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dear old man, quite different
from&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off abruptly, and turned to her
husband, who was tugging moodily at his moustache. &ldquo;John, I
expect Captain Hayle would like a wash and a drink before
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bush brightened up considerably after the second cocktail, and after
the fourth&mdash;his fourth, Basil was more careful&mdash;he was quite
familiar and sympathetic. &ldquo;Shame to send you up there,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;A rabble like yours is no good. They ought to have sent a
couple of companies of Scouts. We should have cleaned them up, sure
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil bit his lip, but did not reply. Afterwards, when he came to
look back on that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92"
name="pb92">92</a>]</span>dinner, it seemed to him one of the most
miserable experiences of his life. It was bad enough to sit down with a
couple who, as the husband made only too clear, had nothing in common;
but when that husband was also guilty of drinking far too much, showing
he had drunk too much, the position became unbearable. Still, there was
one redeeming feature&mdash;the way in which Mrs Bush tried to make the
best of the situation. She talked rapidly, nervously, all the time,
trying to avoid any topic which might possibly lead to discussion; but
Bush&rsquo;s temporary burst of good-nature quickly changed to
aggressiveness, then to actual surliness, and some of the things he
said made Basil go white with rage. The Scout officer&rsquo;s friends
had lost no opportunity of telling him that his wife&rsquo;s Southern
pride was the cause of his domestic unhappiness, and when he found that
the guest was also from the South, he felt he had discovered a
legitimate source of grievance. Had they been alone, there would have
been a fight; but Basil glanced at Mrs Bush, sitting white-faced and
rigid, and remembered the duty he owed to his hostess.</p>
<p>At last the meal was over. Mrs Bush rose, and as Hayle opened the
door for her, &ldquo;I think we had better go up on the balcony,
Captain Hayle. It will be pleasanter there,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Her husband got up too, then staggered, and went down on to his
knees. Basil turned to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93"
name="pb93">93</a>]</span>help him, but stopped when Mrs Bush laid a
restraining hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see to him, Captain Hayle,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
was afraid he was not very well to-night. Perhaps you had better
go;&rdquo; but she saw him out, saying good-bye to him at the door,
before she returned to the invalid, who had got back into his chair and
greeted her with a curse.</p>
<p>Don Juan Ramirez, who was very like what old Don Jos&eacute; had
been thirty years previously, shook his head when Basil mentioned that
he had dined with the Bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he&mdash;was he as usual?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Basil&rsquo;s pent-up wrath broke out. &ldquo;If being as usual
means being a foul-mouthed, drunken hog, with a wife a million times
too good for him, then he was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Spaniard nodded. &ldquo;He seldom dines at home. Perhaps she
thought that, with a guest there, he would&mdash;he would be moderate.
Poor lady! He drinks all day with the Presidente, a mestizo insurrecto,
and with the Supervisor and the school teacher who came from his own
State. Then there is worse. There is a mestiza girl&mdash;under his
wife&rsquo;s eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil Hayle walked up and down the room, raging, whilst the old
Spaniard watched him sympathetically, understanding, being a worthy
nephew of Don Jos&eacute; of Calocan. Then, adroitly, he turned the
conversation on to the subject of that morning&rsquo;s fight.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You were rash,&rdquo; he said, when Basil had finished.
&ldquo;But you were lucky to escape yourself. Why, Felizardo must have
three hundred bolomen&mdash;five hundred perhaps, as well as many
rifles. My uncle knew him well before he took to the hills. Old Don
Jos&eacute; did not love the Filipinos&mdash;who could?&mdash;but he
used to say always that Felizardo was a gentleman, even though he had
killed a priest. Your Government will never catch Felizardo, Senor,
never. They will waste lives and money, and they will find that, in the
end, Felizardo will be stronger than ever. Why, to-morrow, when the
news of your ill-fortune is known, there will be hundreds of fresh
recruits clamouring to join his band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning Basil wrote his report to Mr Commissioner Furber,
telling the truth, plainly and baldly; then he sent it off by a launch
which happened to come in, and sat down to wait for the reply,
half-hoping that the latter would take the form of his dismissal. He
wanted to get right away, he told himself, not because of
Felizardo&rsquo;s bolomen, but because, as had been the case when
Felizardo himself had first met Father Pablo in San Polycarpio, the
instinct to kill had awakened in him. He had caught the spirit of the
Islands, where the Law of the Bolo is the natural code, and if he
remained he knew he should kill Captain Bush.</p>
<p>He told himself that he was a fool, that, after all, they were
strangers with whom he had no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href=
"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>concern, that he would avoid them in
future; and then, seeing Mrs Bush walking across the plaza, he took his
hat and hurried after her, completing the mischief, so far as he
himself was concerned&mdash;possibly, too, so far as she was
concerned.</p>
<p>The school teacher saw them out of the window of the spirit shop,
and winked at the Supervisor, who glanced out too, and then called to
Bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Captain. The Virginian seems to have cottoned on to your
wife. Two Southerners, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bush flushed, half-rose with the intention of having a look, then
resumed his seat; but he did not forget the words, thereby fulfilling
the intentions of his friends.</p>
<p>That night, a messenger left Igut with a letter for Felizardo,
written by no less a person than the Supervisor&rsquo;s principal
clerk, who was also, in a sense, the Supervisor&rsquo;s brother-in-law.
In that letter the clerk, who was no mean observer, made some pointed,
and, as it happened, perfectly true remarks concerning Captain Basil
Hayle&rsquo;s feelings towards Mrs Bush&mdash;remarks which, as
subsequent events proved, Felizardo did not forget. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER V</h2>
<h2 class="main">HOW MR COMMISSIONER GUMPERTZ AND MR JOSEPH GOBBITT
TALKED OF HIGH FINANCE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Mr Joseph Gobbitt&rsquo;s friends heard that
&ldquo;Old Joe&rdquo; himself was going out to Manila to bring order
into the chaos caused by the sudden death of young Albert Dunk, they
shook their heads gravely. It was a foolish and unnecessary thing to
do, they declared. The firm of Gobbitt and Dunk had not a very large
sum at stake in the Philippines, and one of the other young Dunks, or
even Pretty, the chief clerk, would have been able to do all that was
necessary. Mr Gobbitt, however, knew his own mind, and, after only a
week of preparation, started overland, to catch the Hong Kong mail
steamer.</p>
<p>It is curious how some people get the names which suit them exactly.
Joseph Gobbitt was a case in point. Inevitably, you expected a man of
East Anglian tradesman stock; and the moment you set eyes on him, you
felt you had been right. Hosea Gobbitt, his father, had been mayor and
pork-butcher in a small Suffolk <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"
href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>town, having risen to wealth and
position by what he called &ldquo;judicious trading.&rdquo; &ldquo;A
little bit of all sorts, for all sorts of people,&rdquo; he used to say
to his particular friends at the Tradesmen&rsquo;s Meetings&mdash;which
meant that those customers who were particular got meat for which he
had to pay the farmers what he considered a wholly outrageous price,
showing a bare profit of sixty per cent.; whilst those who were
careless, or in his debt, as well as those who ventured on sausages and
similar mysteries, were liable to get the product of those diseased
swine which the inspector was kind enough, and wise enough, to let him
have for a few shillings each. After all, what is the use of holding
Municipal Office unless you make something out of it to pay for your
time? What tradesman in England ever did&mdash;at least what tradesman
of his, Hosea Gobbitt&rsquo;s, ability? Footman the ironmonger, and
Woods the grocer&mdash;&ldquo;Sandy&rdquo; Woods they used to call him
amongst themselves, because of his sugar, not because of his
hair&mdash;did very well over contracts, and there was no reason why he
should not do well over pork. After all, the inspector was their
servant; they could discharge him at any moment.</p>
<p>Joseph Gobbitt learnt the rudiments of business in his
father&rsquo;s shop; but he had no intention of spending his life in a
country town; consequently, at the age of eighteen he went to London,
and obtained a junior clerkship in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98"
href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>a Mincing Lane house. When he
was thirty, he entered into partnership with Henry Dunk, and proceeded
to turn the knowledge he had secured to such good use that, within five
years, he had pretty well ruined his former employers. When he was
sixty, he was reckoned, if not amongst the biggest men of Mincing Lane,
at least amongst the bigger ones. He had several branches in the East,
including one at Manila, which had been under the charge of Albert
Dunk, son of his late partner. Taken all round, matters were going very
well when, just about the time that Basil Hayle began the campaign
against Felizardo, Albert Dunk died suddenly, and, to Mr
Gobbitt&rsquo;s mind, mysteriously. Edward Dunk, the new junior
partner, Albert&rsquo;s elder brother, had volunteered to go out; but,
greatly to his surprise, Mr Gobbitt had declared his intention of going
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can manage here by yourself, Edward,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I have every confidence in you, every confidence. The sea-trip
will do me good, and possibly there may be complications in Manila
which we have not foreseen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward Dunk, not unnaturally, took the latter sentence as a slur on
his brother&rsquo;s memory, as foreshadowing unpleasant discoveries,
and he laid his plans accordingly, with a view to repaying Mr Gobbitt
in kind. As a matter of fact, however, it was a chance conversation
with an American consular official <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99"
href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>which had determined the senior
partner to go to the East. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s money they want out in the
Islands,&rdquo; the American had said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of
good things to be got cheap&mdash;concessions, hemp lands, Church lands
even; though our own people hold back, not knowing if we shall stay out
there, whilst the British banks and financiers are too
fastidious&mdash;won&rsquo;t grease the Commissioners&rsquo; palms.
There&rsquo;s a fortune, sir, for the man who will risk his dollars.
And it isn&rsquo;t much risk, anyway. We are bound to stay in the
Islands, now we&rsquo;ve been chuckleheads enough to take
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Joseph Gobbitt pondered deeply over these words during the long
journey to Hong Kong, where, from his own manager, he obtained a
certain degree of confirmation; but before he had been in Manila two
days, he knew that they were true. He called officially on Mr
Commissioner Gumpertz, head of the Departments of Lands and
Registration, in the hope of obtaining full particulars concerning the
end of Albert Dunk, who had met his death somewhere near Hippapad,
which, of course, is on the other side of Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains,
a full ten miles&mdash;more, perhaps&mdash;to the north of the
range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The report was that he died of fever,&rdquo; the official
said. &ldquo;They buried him where he died. Violence? Murder? My dear
sir, no. The Islands are pacified now. You could go from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>end
to end of them unarmed. Pay no heed to the wild stories you will hear,
stories circulated deliberately by our political enemies, and by the
Army, which is jealous of our success. You are sure to hear them all,
perhaps more than I hear.&rdquo; Unconsciously he slipped some blank
sheets of paper over a copy of Captain Basil Hayle&rsquo;s report,
which he had just been studying anew&mdash;the grim record of
forty-seven men out of sixty-five slaughtered on Felizardo&rsquo;s
mountains by Felizardo&rsquo;s bolomen. &ldquo;You will hear them
because you are the type of man, a broad-minded capitalist, whom they
are specially anxious to keep out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words gave Mr Gobbitt his cue, and a few minutes later they were
no longer talking officially, but privately, about a railway concession
and a copra concession, but most of all about some hemp lands. Mr
Gobbitt was essentially a business man, and he put his finger on the
weak spot, or what seemed the weak spot, at once. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he
asked, &ldquo;if there is all this splendid hemp land vacant, have not
people, the natives for instance, or the Spaniards, made use of
it?&rdquo; And he leaned back in his chair, twirling his gold-rimmed
glasses.</p>
<p>The Commissioner met his objections with an easy smile. &ldquo;You
know what the Spaniards were. Did they make use of anything? Moreover,
in their days there were large bands of ladrones in the
neighbourhood.&rdquo; Mr Gobbitt <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101"
href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>knit his forehead, and was
making a mental note of the drawback, when the Commissioner went on:
&ldquo;But there are none now. We have cleared them all out, all; and
we have a company of Constabulary under a most energetic officer,
Captain Hayle, quartered permanently in the district. Then, as to your
other point, is it likely we should allow any unauthorised person to
seize this land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Joseph Gobbitt got up. He divined that, at the first interview
with a high official, it would hardly be diplomatic to talk of
business, of the sort of business which was obviously intended.
&ldquo;I will think it over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Possibly I may hear
from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commissioner rose, too. &ldquo;Very possibly some friends of
mine might call,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Down at the Consulate, the Vice-Consul received Mr Gobbitt with what
that pillar of finance considered most unbecoming levity. &ldquo;Got
anything out of old Gumpertz?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I suppose you had
a long lecture on Liberty and Brown Brothers. No? You are lucky, then.
He&rsquo;s not what you might call inspired, unless it&rsquo;s on a
question of dollars. He got his job because he kept some big city solid
for the Party, they say. He owned, or bought up, all the bars in the
place, lost his money over it, and so, to keep him quiet and give him a
chance to retrieve his fortune, they sent him out here. He is
retrieving fast, but he&rsquo;s really still what <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>he
was by birth, a petty, huckstering tradesman. They say that his father
used to be a pork-butcher in the Happy Fatherland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had it not been for the last few words, Mr Gobbitt might have paid
some attention to the rest; but those decided him. Obviously, the whole
thing was rank prejudice. He got up, waving aside a proffered cigar.
&ldquo;Thank you. I do not smoke. Is the Consul in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vice-Consul got up wearily. &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t I do? Oh, very
well. I&rsquo;ll see. He was having an extra siesta; didn&rsquo;t feel
quite the thing after tiffin. I&rsquo;d be careful of the Club whisky,
if I were you. Rotten brand they&rsquo;ve got on tap now;&rdquo; and,
without noticing Mr Gobbitt&rsquo;s indignant looks, he lounged into
the inner office.</p>
<p>The Consul, or rather Acting-Consul, the regular Consul-General
being on leave, did not seem exactly delighted to see Mr Gobbitt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you hear anything new from Gumpertz?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt shook his head. &ldquo;He says Mr Dunk died of fever and
was buried in the jungle. That is all they know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Consul yawned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about their mark. The Army
would have sent out to see quick, and so would the Guardia <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e1235" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span>. Those people
get in a fluster if a native is killed, and don&rsquo;t worry about a
white man. Is that all? Find your books all right?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>The visitor flushed. He did not like this man any better than he
liked the Vice-Consul. &ldquo;They were correct,&rdquo; he said
severely. &ldquo;The books of our firm always are. But there is one
curious thing&mdash;the day before he left Manila Mr Dunk drew ten
thousand pesos from the bank; and we cannot trace to whom he paid
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Ten thousand pesos, eh?&rdquo; The Consul whistled in
what struck Mr Gobbitt as a most undignified manner. &ldquo;A big sum
that. Was he&mdash;do you think he was mixed up in any sort of graft
here&mdash;corruption, you&rsquo;d call it&mdash;with the
officials?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was wrath on Mr Gobbitt&rsquo;s face as he got up from his
chair. &ldquo;Sir, members of our firm are not mixed up in such
things&#8202;&hellip;. No, sir, I do not smoke; nor will I have a
whisky-and-soda. I, myself, drink only at meals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had gone, with such dignity as a large and perspiring man,
who wears a frock-coat in the Tropics, can command, the Acting-Consul
yawned again. &ldquo;Queer old chap. Isn&rsquo;t he in a
paddy-whack!&rdquo; Then he went to the door and called the
Vice-Consul. &ldquo;I say, Blackiston, come and drink the
whisky-and-soda our heavy friend refused. Did he slam the door as he
went out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Joseph Gobbitt did not go to the English Club that night, partly
because he was unwilling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>to run the risk of further shocks
to his dignity, but chiefly because he thought it possible that some
friends of Mr Commissioner Gumpertz might chance to call on him. The
latter supposition proved to be correct. He had just finished dinner,
and was waiting on the veranda of the hotel for his coffee, when the
waiter announced two gentlemen, who introduced themselves as Mr William
P. Hart and Senor de Vega, the latter being a mestizo. Mr Gobbitt
received them graciously, scenting business, and it only needed two
liqueurs to produce a definite proposition. Mr William P. Hart was not
shy, whilst Senor de Vega backed him loyally in all he had to say.
There was this splendid stretch of hemp-growing land on the north of
the range of mountains, which Mr Gobbitt had doubtless noticed. Mr
Commissioner Gumpertz had the selling of it, and the
Commissioner&rsquo;s price would be so much for himself&mdash;or rather
for himself, Mr Hart, and Senor de Vega&mdash;and so much for the
Government. There was no useless beating about the bush, a feature
which Mr Gobbitt rather appreciated. It was, after all, a plain matter
of business, and, as it was shorn of all pretence and shams, a business
man could discuss it.</p>
<p>They came to terms, provisionally. Mr Gobbitt had made careful
enquiries as to the value of really good hemp land in that part of the
island, and he knew that, if he bought at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>figure named, he would be making an amazingly
good bargain. Unfortunately, however, he did not know good hemp land
from bad&mdash;or, for that matter, from any other sort of land; and
much though he respected the cleverness, the money-making genius, of
Commissioner Gumpertz, he was not going to take that gentleman&rsquo;s
word for anything which involved financial risk to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must inspect this land first, of course,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;That is only a matter of common sense. I will find some reliable
person who can give me an expert opinion on it, and then, if he reports
favourably, I will come to terms with &hellip; with your
Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Commissioner?&rdquo; Mr Hart asked, with a leer.</p>
<p>The merchant bowed gravely. &ldquo;And the Commissioner, of course.
That is understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done without him.&rdquo; Mr Hart was inclined
to frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite unnecessary to tell me that.&rdquo; Mr Gobbitt
spoke severely. &ldquo;I am accustomed to business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing more.&rdquo; Mr Hart laid a hand which was
none too clean on his host&rsquo;s knee. &ldquo;The Commissioner wants
a deposit, so that he has something to show the Government, in case
another buyer happens along. He wants six thousand dollars, gold, down;
to be refunded if you do not wish to complete the purchase at the end
of three months.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href=
"#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt frowned. It was a large sum; but then the value of the
land would be enormous. &ldquo;Six thousand dollars. Humph! Twelve
hundred pounds&mdash;a great deal of money. If I considered the
proposal&mdash;I do not say I shall&mdash;I should require the proper
receipt of the Department, not the mere private receipt of the
Commissioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The readiness with which Mr Hart assented dissipated the
other&rsquo;s suspicions. &ldquo;Certainly, sir, it would be an
official receipt; and any time you wished to call off you could get
your money back. It is proposed just in your interest, to give you a
free run with no competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had gone, Mr Gobbitt sat for a long time deep in thought.
This was the sort of business he had come out hoping to do, and
therefore he was prepared to make certain allowances for the weakness
of those with whom he was dealing. When one is about to reap huge
profits, one cannot be over-censorious concerning those who are
assisting one. He thought the whole scheme out before he went to bed
that night, the sum he would expend on it&mdash;it would be his private
venture, nothing to do with the firm of Gobbitt &amp; Dunk&mdash;the
sum for which he would float it as soon as he had got it into working
order, and the profits which he himself would make out of the
flotation. It was all very simple and straightforward. There
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>was always a demand for hemp, always would be a
demand for it. No crop paid better to raise, no crop, so far as he
knew, involved less capital expenditure on clearing the land and
planting. As for security of title, he would make certain on that point
before he parted with any of the purchase-money, whilst he was shrewd
enough to see that there was no prospect of the Americans withdrawing
from the Islands for many years to come, until long after he had
floated his company.</p>
<p>The matter of the deposit did not trouble him greatly. After all,
the sum was not a large one to him; he ran no risk of losing it; and it
would be a distinct advantage to have what would amount to a three
months&rsquo; option. It was a cheap option, after all, a very cheap
one; and the more he thought of it, the more convinced he became that,
in the end, he would be able to get the better of Mr Gumpertz in many
ways. He, himself, would have insisted on a payment outright, in
addition to the deposit.</p>
<p>In the morning, Mr Gobbitt set out to find a reliable man to advise
him on the question of the hemp lands. It was rather a delicate matter.
He did not want to advertise the fact that he had any business of the
kind in contemplation, yet, at the same time, he was anxious to secure
some one who would be thoroughly trustworthy. It would not do to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>go to the new manager of the Manila branch of
Gobbitt &amp; Dunk, for this was his personal affair&mdash;the Dunk
family had done well enough out of him already, even though old Dunk
had found the capital in the first instance&mdash;and he did not fancy
the idea of consulting the Acting-Consul. In the end, he decided to
call on the bank manager, to whom he could speak in confidence.</p>
<p>The bank manager looked dubious. &ldquo;Yes, I can get you a good
man&mdash;several, if you like, men you can trust. There&rsquo;s John
Mackay, a Scotchman, and Lucio Morales, a Spaniard&mdash;either would
do well; and I would take the opinion of either as final. Only, let me
warn you, Mr Gobbitt, that this is a risky form of speculation. Hemp
pays well enough until the insurrectos, or the pulajanes, or the
ladrones come along and burn your place and cut your men&rsquo;s
throats. It&rsquo;s all very well for Furber and Gumpertz and the rest
to say the Islands are at peace. Gumpertz may know all about pork-chops
and public-houses, but it doesn&rsquo;t follow he understands these
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son of Hosea Gobbitt, pork-butcher and mayor, flushed. It was
only too clear that Mr Gumpertz had been right when he talked about
unreasoning prejudice and a desire to injure the Government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I am fully aware of the conditions,&rdquo; he said
severely. &ldquo;I have made the most <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>exhaustive enquiries
from those who should know.&rdquo; Unconsciously he emphasised the last
five words. &ldquo;And now, if you would give me the addresses of these
two men, Mackay and Morales, I will ask them to call on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senor Morales was the first to make his appearance at the hotel, a
grave young Spaniard, whose rather elaborate courtesy disconcerted Mr
Gobbitt somewhat; but when the proposition was put to him bluntly, as
such things should be put, he shook his head. &ldquo;No, Senor. It is
impossible that I go. These Americans have got the country into such a
state, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He spread out his hands expressively,
and rose to leave.</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt rose too, a little annoyed at the waste of his time.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like the Americans?&rdquo; he said, with what he
took for sternness, and the other for rudeness.</p>
<p>The Spaniard laughed gently. &ldquo;Why, no, Senor. Why should I, a
Spaniard, like them?&rdquo; And he went out, leaving Mr Gobbitt more
than ever convinced of the intense prejudice against the
administration.</p>
<p>Mr John Mackay, who did not arrive till late in the afternoon,
proved to be more suitable. He was middle-aged and hard-faced, at least
when he was talking business, and he went to the root of the matter at
once&mdash;the question of his professional fee, which was finally
settled more to his own satisfaction than to that of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>Mr
Gobbitt, who had a distinct aversion to giving mere employ&eacute;s a
chance to imitate the late Jeshurun, of whom the one recorded fact is
that &ldquo;he waxed fat and kicked.&rdquo; Still, John Mackay knew
what he himself wanted, and he had the knowledge which Mr Gobbitt
wanted, so, for once in his life at least, the merchant agreed to pay a
fair wage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where are we going to?&rdquo; John Mackay asked.</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt hesitated. &ldquo;Well, I must tell you, I suppose; but
it is in confidence, the strictest confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scotchman gave a quick little nod; he was not prone to
unnecessary speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We land at a place called Igut, and from there make our way
round the end of that large range of mountains to some land on the
northern side. They tell me&mdash;Commissioner Gumpertz tells
me&mdash;that the journey will not be a difficult one. We keep in the
valley for some twenty-five miles, then cross at an easy
pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking any escort?&rdquo; the Scotchman asked.</p>
<p>The merchant shook his head. &ldquo;I am informed it is quite
unnecessary; though some of the native soldiers&mdash;Scouts, I think
they are called&mdash;will come along to help us with transport
arrangements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Mackay stroked his chin thoughtfully. &ldquo;Well, at least
they all know me well enough<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>&mdash;Felizardo, and the others
as well. I myself can go anywhere;&rdquo; a saying which gave food for
thought to Mr Gobbitt, who could not decide whether it was to be
construed as encouraging or otherwise.</p>
<p>Commissioner Gumpertz received Mr Gobbitt very graciously when that
gentleman came to pay the deposit. &ldquo;I am delighted, sir,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;flattered to think you are taking my advice, which was
given in the interests of these Islands and their people, and proves,
most fortunately, to be in your interest as well. I might tell you, in
confidence, that there will be a bill before Congress next session
forbidding these large sales of land&mdash;a most unfortunate proposal;
but your business will be through long before then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, however, Mr Gobbitt handed him a cheque, crossed, for the
deposit, the Commissioner looked doubtful. &ldquo;I am afraid, sir, I
cannot take this&mdash;my dear sir, I mean no slight on
yourself&mdash;but the rules of the Department are very strict. No
cheques taken, they say. Still, would you write another one, a bearer
cheque, and I will send a messenger down to the bank with it. That will
only take ten minutes, and we can fix up the matter at once. If you
will excuse me, I will get the secretary to make out the
receipt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came back, a few minutes later, with the receipt which his
secretary, whose name was William P. Hart, had made out in due
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>form. It was already signed, and, as he handed
it to his visitor, the Commissioner for Lands and Registration remarked
jocularly: &ldquo;Now, Mr Gobbitt, you have my receipt before I have
the money. You have only to stop the messenger on the way, and you can
make six thousand dollars out of the Department, or rather out of me,
for they would hold me responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt, who had assured himself at a glance that the receipt was
in due form, laughed too. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think in my firm we do
things like that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We rather pride ourselves on
being old-fashioned&mdash;almost straight-laced, perhaps. My father
always impressed on me that honesty paid in the long run, and I have
found that he was right. I have no doubt your experience has been the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commissioner nodded. This was a most admirable and tactful man
of business. It is always pleasant to keep affairs of this sort on a
certain high plane. If you talk of the Welfare of the People, or the
Will of the Multitude, or the Moral Aspect, you can make infinitely
more money than if you adopt a crudely-commercial tone, especially if
you have a William P. Hart in the background.</p>
<p>The messenger returned with the package of notes, which he handed to
Mr Gobbitt, who in turn handed them to Mr Commissioner Gumpertz; and
then the two men parted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The launch will be ready for you early to-morrow,&rdquo; the
official said. &ldquo;I will send you down letters of introduction from
Commissioner Furber&mdash;you must meet him on your return&mdash;to
Captain Bush at Igut, and Captain Basil Hayle, who has a camp somewhere
on the edge of the jungle. Captain Bush will arrange all your equipment
for you, or at least he will get the local officials to do so. Now,
good-bye, Mr Gobbitt, and good luck. I shall look forward to your early
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Joseph Gobbitt was an experienced business man. He prided himself
on the fact that there was little he did not know about certain forms
of finance; yet, had he learnt that, instead of being paid into the
account of the Government, those notes of his were, that very night,
distributed, at a slight discount, through some of the most shady, and
even improper, quarters in Manila, he might have found food for much
speculation and thought. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href=

pair of side-whiskers of which he was distinctly proud; consequently,
though he certainly did appear impressive when carrying the
bag&mdash;he was vicar&rsquo;s churchwarden in a suburban
church&mdash;he looked almost ridiculous when he landed on the quay at
Igut, attired in a very tight khaki suit, with an immense
khaki-coloured helmet on his head. At least, he appeared ridiculous to
Mrs Bush, who watched his arrival from the balcony of her house, and,
for the first time since Basil Hayle had left, five weeks previously,
her face lighted up with a smile.</p>
<p>Basil Hayle had not been dismissed in consequence of his crushing
defeat at the hands of Felizardo&rsquo;s bolomen; in fact, greatly to
his surprise, he had not even been reprimanded. Commissioner Furber had
been quick to see that really he, himself, was to blame for having
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>sent the small force of Constabulary against the
outlaws; and he was not anxious to have Basil back in Manila, telling
all men of what had happened on the mountain-side. Consequently, he had
sent Basil fifty fresh men&mdash;from the Island of Samar, like those
who had been killed&mdash;and had ordered him to proceed to the
northern side of the range, and build a regular stockaded camp in the
neighbourhood of one of the villages; meanwhile, Captain Bush&rsquo;s
Scouts were to watch the southern side of the range, learning the lay
of the country, endeavouring to obtain information concerning Felizardo
and his band, and, as far as possible, preparing the way for a large
expedition, which the Government intended to despatch in a few
months&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>From first to last, Basil Hayle had only remained ten days in Igut,
but the time had sufficed to complete his infatuation for Mrs Bush, and
to confirm his detestation of her husband. At first by accident, then
by design, he had met Mrs Bush practically every day, whilst he had
barely spoken to Bush or his white associates. Old Don Juan Ramirez,
the Spanish merchant, had told him all about the lives they
led&mdash;of the mestiza girls at the other end of the town, and the
drinking bouts in the spirit shop at the corner of the plaza; with the
result that Basil had considered himself perfectly justified in taking
the part of Mrs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span>Bush against all the others, in showing his
respect for her, and his scorn for them&mdash;which was very chivalrous
in theory, and very injudicious in practice, as he had realised the
moment he received orders to leave Igut. Still, in the end, his parting
from her had been admirably unemotional; and if she did cry for hours
after he had gone, and if his feelings did find vent in Language, no
one in Igut had been aware of these facts.</p>
<p>In Europe and America, where men and women are discreet, such things
do not happen&mdash;at least they are supposed not to happen&mdash;for
fear of the Law, or the Church, or of the Mightiest One of all, Mrs
Grundy; but in the Tropics, especially in the Philippines, and more
especially under the shadow of places like Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains,
where Death is stalking by your side all day, squatting just outside
the circle of firelight at night, conventions are apt to lose much of
their force. Basil Hayle was in love with Mrs Bush. That would have
been very wicked elsewhere, possibly it was wicked in Igut; but what
was wholly admirable was that, in the circumstances, Basil Hayle did
not become an open convert to the Law of the Bolo, and deal with
Captain Bush according to that code. But this is a view of the case
which few could understand, unless they had lived with bolomen as the
background of their lives.</p>
<p>Basil Hayle had marched away up the valley <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>to
the end of Felizardo&rsquo;s range, over the pass which formed the
boundary of the old outlaw&rsquo;s territory, and down into the rich
hemp lands on the other side where, near a village called Silang, he
had built a stockaded post, after the custom of the Islands&mdash;big
nipa-covered shacks, surrounded at a little distance by a high
palisade, with a platform at a convenient height, and little
watch-towers at each corner; and then he had sat down, and drilled his
little brown men, and taught them to shoot, and, incidentally, taught
them to love him above everything else on earth, and had waited
patiently for the coming of Felizardo, or the ladrones, or the
head-hunters, or any one else who was in search of trouble, being tired
of looking for trouble for himself. Yet, all the time, he was thinking
of Mrs Bush, wishing he could write, but not writing for fear of the
letter going astray; though, had he but known, she heard of him, of his
safety and his continued good health, every few days, and she concluded
that the messages came from him, never suspecting that the servant who
delivered them received them from a certain clerk in the
Supervisor&rsquo;s office, the same clerk who had sent word concerning
Basil and Mrs Bush to Felizardo; and whence that clerk now obtained the
messages it is not hard to guess. Old Felizardo or Dolores Lasara could
have told you&#8202;&hellip;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118"
href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he landed at Igut and found that there was no hotel in the
place, Mr Joseph Gobbitt turned angrily to John Mackay. &ldquo;Most
scandalous thing! You should have warned me about this. We may be here
a day, even two days. What are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scotchman answered without removing his cigar from his
mouth&mdash;Mr Gobbitt hated to see an employ&eacute;, a mere paid
person, smoking in his presence, as Mackay had already divined.
&ldquo;I guess the Bushes will put you up, whilst I shall go to old Don
Juan&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt snorted, not liking the casual disposal of himself, and
his temper was not improved when, without the slightest warning, he
found himself the centre of an unusually vigorous dog-and-pig fight,
none of the combatants in which was over-clean. &ldquo;Most scandalous
thing,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;most scandalous! I wonder what the
police can be about to allow it. I shall certainly summons the owners
if I can&#8202;&hellip;. I am sure I see nothing to smile at, Mr
Mackay,&rdquo; he added with great dignity.</p>
<p>A moment later, Captain Bush lounged up, and nodded to Mackay.
&ldquo;Hullo, John. What&rsquo;s on now? Coming across soon?&rdquo;
indicating the spirit shop with a jerk of his thumb. He was passing on,
to see if there were any mails on the launch, when Mackay stopped him.
&ldquo;Here, Captain. This is Mr Joseph Gobbitt of London, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>who
has a letter of introduction to you from the Commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Bush pulled himself together. &ldquo;Glad to meet you, sir.
If you&rsquo;ll wait a moment, we might go up to the house together. It
is only a step. I suppose you&rsquo;re not going on. No? Well, you must
stay with us. My wife will be delighted. Here, muchachos, take the
Senor&rsquo;s luggage up to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Bush was in an exceptionally good humour, having just won
some money off the Treasurer; but, in addition to that, he had
understood instantly that the stranger must be a man of position,
probably a wealthy English merchant and his own state of chronic
insolvency made it necessary for him to lose no chances.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mrs Bush was not favourably impressed with this
suddenly-arrived guest; certainly, he was not favourably impressed with
her, or at least he did not like her. Amongst men, even amongst those
of far better social position than himself, he was able to hold his own
by reason of a certain aggressive strength of character; but when he
found himself in the company of a lady, he was hopelessly at a loss,
and, as is the way of his kind, revenged himself by abusing her
afterwards.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush did not stay long in the room. &ldquo;I see you have
business to discuss,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so I will leave you till
dinner. Be sure and look after Mr&mdash;Mr Gobbitt, John.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>At first, Mr Gobbitt was not very communicative, telling his host
little beyond what was contained in the letter of introduction; but
after a while, under the Scout officer&rsquo;s skilful handling, he
began to thaw, and finally unfolded the whole of his scheme. After all,
he told himself, why not? This American had to give him active aid, was
bound to know everything very shortly, whilst his deposit of six
thousand dollars secured him against possible competitors.</p>
<p>Captain Bush was a little puzzled. He was an experienced soldier,
despite his recently-acquired habits; he knew the Islands well, and
therefore could see various weak points in the business; on the other
hand, this man Gobbitt obviously had capital, obviously had the
Government behind him; and it would be most unwise to venture on any
interference at that stage. Later on, perhaps, there might be a chance
of turning the affair to account; but at the moment it was safer merely
to provide the carriers and equipment for which Mr Gumpertz asked, and
detail half a dozen Scouts to go along with the party and keep the
carriers in order. Once the expedition was across the pass, it would be
Basil Hayle&rsquo;s task to look after it, and Captain Bush grinned to
himself as he thought of the possible trouble which this stout and
pompous old man might cause the Constabulary officer. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>At dinner, Mrs Bush made an attempt to talk to Mr Gobbitt, then,
finding they had no interests in common, relapsed into silence. When
she rose to leave the room, somehow she had to open the door for
herself, whereat she raised her eyebrows slightly. Mr Gobbitt, deep in
conversation with his host, never seemed to notice her go.</p>
<p>After a while, Captain Bush yawned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s slow here.
Ever seen a Filipino town at night? No, I don&rsquo;t suppose you have.
Would you like a walk round?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went first to the spirit shop, where the Englishman became
almost jovial. It may have been the sense of being free for once from
his frock-coat; it may have been the cocktails on which Captain Bush
had insisted before dinner; it may have been the native spirit which
the Supervisor suggested he should taste; but whatever the cause, time
seemed to pass very quickly indeed, and when, about midnight, the
school teacher suggested they should have a stroll down to the lower
end of the town, Mr Joseph Gobbitt, merchant and churchwarden, had no
objection to make.</p>
<p>When he awakened in the morning, in the big spare room which Mrs
Bush had prepared for him, he had rather a vague recollection of the
walk home. Other things were vague also, but of two things he was
certain&mdash;that he had a splitting headache, and that the beauty of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>mestizas was not overrated. When Captain Bush
came in, the merchant mentioned the former fact, whereat his host
laughed, and went on to refer to the latter, thereby making Mr Gobbitt
rather uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush did not come down to breakfast that morning, and she did
not trouble to make any excuses. She had heard certain rumours from her
maid, which had sent her white with passion. She was used to her
husband&rsquo;s ways&mdash;but her guest! It was absolutely abominable.
Mr Gobbitt, on his part, was thankful for her absence. He made no
reference to the fact, however, nor did his host; and as soon as the
meal was over, they went out together to make arrangements for the
carriers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a road part of the way, twenty miles or so up
the valley, and you can ride so far in a bullock-cart&rdquo;&mdash;Mr
Gobbitt had declined the offer of a horse&mdash;&ldquo;but from there
onwards it&rsquo;ll be a case of walking,&rdquo; the Scout officer
said.</p>
<p>The merchant sighed. He was not a good walker; then he thought of
the profits he would make out of the trip, and straightway became
reconciled to the idea.</p>
<p>The arrangements were quickly made, thanks to the help of the
Presidente, and Mr Gobbitt breathed more freely. He was anxious to get
away as soon as possible for various reasons, of which Mrs Bush was
one.</p>
<p>As they walked back to the house, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>Englishman remembered
a question he had meant to ask before. &ldquo;Did you ever meet a son
of my late partner, Dunk&mdash;Albert Dunk, who was our manager in
Manila? He died near Hippapad some months back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain shook his head. &ldquo;He never passed through here.
Probably he landed at Catarman, further round the bay. You might have
gone in that way, too. I wonder old Gumpertz didn&rsquo;t suggest
it&#8202;&hellip;. No, very little news of that sort drifts across the
mountains to us. You see, there&rsquo;re so few white men on that side
for a good many miles; then, of course, you get plenty
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, John Mackay had strolled out of the town, carrying a
small switch as his sole weapon. About a mile past the last shack, he
sat down at the edge of the cocoa-nut grove, lit a cigar, and puffed
away contentedly. A few minutes later, a little man, clad in blue jean
and wearing two formidable-looking bolos, emerged from the bush some
twenty yards away, looked cautiously up and down the grove, then came
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Senor,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>John Mackay nodded. &ldquo;Good-morning, Simon. Can a message go to
the Senor Felizardo? It is this&mdash;I am going round this side of his
mountain and across the pass with an Englishman. There will be six
Scouts to look after the carriers, that is all. He will leave us
alone?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p>The little man grinned. &ldquo;Assuredly he will leave the Senor
alone, as always. Only he will ask&mdash;where does the Senor go
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the northern valley. Not on to his mountains at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Senor. The message will go;&rdquo; and the outlaw
disappeared as silently as he had come.</p>
<p>Felizardo said afterwards that John Mackay should have been more
explicit as to his exact destination, in which case the latter part of
this story would have been very different&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Mr Joseph Gobbitt did not like the twenty-mile ride in the cart,
which was drawn by a couple of water-buffalo, beasts for which he
seemed to entertain a most wholesome dread. He was absolutely shaken to
pieces, as he told John Mackay, with what that naturally-silent person
seemed to consider wearisome persistency; yet he liked the climb over
the pass still less; and when they reached the northern valley, he
insisted on a rest of two days, despite the protests of John Mackay,
who urged: &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only some fifteen miles now to
Hayle&rsquo;s stockade at Silang. He can put you up comfortably there,
whilst I have a run round and look at the land. From what I can see, it
is all right. We are at a fair elevation, even here, quite high enough
above sea-level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr Gobbitt was firm. &ldquo;I will rest here, and then we will
go straight on. I see no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href=
"#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>reason for wasting time going to
this stockade, which appears to be well off our route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scotchman shrugged his shoulders, and rested too; then, on the
third morning, they moved down the valley slowly, cutting across from
one side to another, so as to get an accurate idea of the whole area.
On the fifth morning their task was practically complete.
Mackay&rsquo;s verdict was wholly favourable. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
valuable land,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;as good as any I know,
except, of course, that in Samar. Only, it is curious no one has made
use of it before. But I suppose they were afraid of the ladrones or of
old Felizardo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Felizardo?&rdquo; the merchant demanded.</p>
<p>The Scotchman jerked his thumb in the direction of the mountains.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the chief up there. An outlaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt flushed. &ldquo;Rubbish! They assure me that all that
sort of thing has been put down, and I can see it now for
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mackay shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Very well. I suppose you know
best. You are my employer, and I have come here merely to advise you on
the nature of the land;&rdquo; and, from that point onwards, he
declined to discuss anything but hemp and hemp-growing.</p>
<p>The following morning they decided to turn back. Mr Gobbitt was now
in great good-humour. There was no question that, at the price
arranged, including the payment to Mr <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>Gumpertz, or rather
to Mr Hart on behalf of Mr Gumpertz, he would be making an
extra-ordinarily good bargain. He forgot the trials of the journey,
that horrible cart, his sore feet and aching limbs; and thought only of
what those trials would bring him ultimately. They were then taking a
route slightly different from that by which they had come, and were
just thinking of making a halt for breakfast, when, to the surprise of
every one, they saw the roofs of some nipa-shacks through the
trees.</p>
<p>The place proved to be the most miserable little village Mackay had
ever seen. There was not a soul in sight, and, as the carriers filed
in, they looked at one another with anxious, questioning faces.</p>
<p>John Mackay turned to the serjeant of the Scouts. &ldquo;What is
this?&rdquo; he asked. Then, as the man shook his head, a sudden
thought struck the Scotchman, and he clambered on to the veranda of the
largest house, a dilapidated place of some size, pulled aside the
matting at the door and went in, revolver in hand. Half a minute later
he came out again, a little pale. &ldquo;As I thought,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Head-hunters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The natives looked at one another with wide-open eyes, whilst Mr
Gobbitt&rsquo;s jaw dropped suddenly. &ldquo;What &hellip; what do you
mean?&rdquo; he quavered. &ldquo;Head-hunters? What are
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who hunt heads&mdash;your head and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>mine, for instance.&rdquo; The Scotchman&rsquo;s
temper was up. &ldquo;There&rsquo;re a dozen heads hanging up inside,
if you want to see, including a white man&rsquo;s. We must get out of
this, quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, it was already too late. As he spoke a score of practically
naked savages, armed with spears and primitive bolos, appeared on the
edge of the clearing. &ldquo;Up here, all of you.&rdquo; Mackay grasped
the situation instantly, but, even whilst the carriers and Scouts were
scrambling on to the platform of the shack, the enemy secured two
heads.</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt was one of the last up; in fact, had not three carriers
assisted him, he would have been in a bad case, for the little ladder
had given way, and climbing was impossible for him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Scouts had begun to blaze away, hitting no one, but
none the less preventing any rush; then Mackay himself took one of the
carbines, and dropped a head-hunter stone-dead&mdash;a lesson which was
not lost, for the rest promptly withdrew to cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will wait till evening now,&rdquo; the serjeant
remarked, &ldquo;then they will attack. They will not try and burn the
place because of those,&rdquo; pointing towards the ghastly trophies
hanging from the roof.</p>
<p>Mackay nodded, and went on with his task of making loopholes in the
walls, although, as he told himself, six carbines and a revolver would
not go very far as means of defence. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt was lying back against some of the hastily-thrown-down
packs, panting. He had lost his helmet, and both his coat and trousers
were torn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disgraceful,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;absolutely disgraceful! I shall report it to the Consul or to
the Foreign Office. Why, I actually saw them kill two of the men in my
presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke to nobody in particular, but Mackay overheard him and
smiled grimly, thinking of the killing which was yet to come; but, in
spite of that, when the merchant had recovered sufficiently to ask
questions, he spoke hopefully, though he added: &ldquo;You see now why
no one has made use of this hemp land, and why they offered it to you
cheaply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt&rsquo;s business instinct overmastered his fear, and he
sat up suddenly. &ldquo;Do you mean that Mr Gumpertz knew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again the Scotchman shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It is quite
possible,&rdquo; he said dryly. &ldquo;And if we had taken a slightly
different route, you would have bought it, not knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant lay back again thinking of many things, of his present
danger, of his narrow escape from buying land having such undesirable
inhabitants, of his deposit which he might not return to claim. Then he
happened to glance upwards and received the greatest shock of his life,
for there, amongst those grisly treasures of the village, was the head
of Albert Dunk. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"
name="pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>John Mackay looked round sharply at the cry, and hurried to his
employer&rsquo;s side. As soon as the Scotchman could make sense out of
the other man&rsquo;s almost incoherent utterance, he reached up and
pulled down the trophy, which he placed beneath a blanket in the
corner; then he gave Mr Gobbitt half a glass of neat brandy, the only
liquid they had, and strove, without much success, to calm him
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall get out of it all right, we shall get out of
it,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;And then we&rsquo;ll get Basil Hayle to
come along, and clear out this gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go now?&rdquo; the merchant asked feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be cut to pieces before we&rsquo;ve gone a quarter of a
mile? No, we must stay here, and chance beating them off when they
attack to-night. Then they&rsquo;ll probably leave us alone
altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is always a weary job, waiting for savages to come and attempt to
kill you, but it becomes even more than a weariness when you are
half-mad with thirst, when you know there is water near by and you dare
not go to it. John Mackay found it long; and the Scouts and carriers
found it long; but it is doubtful whether Mr Joseph Gobbitt, lying in
the corner, was conscious of the passage of time. His thoughts were
just one long nightmare, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>in which Albert Dunk&rsquo;s head,
Commissioner Gumpertz, two dead carriers outside, and a bearer cheque
for six thousand dollars played the principal parts. Once only was his
mind clear for a few minutes; and that was when he remembered Albert
Dunk&rsquo;s bearer cheque for ten thousand pesos&mdash;five thousand
dollars. That had been cashed just as the drawer was starting for this
same district. How he wished that head could speak! Then he fell
a-shuddering at the idea.</p>
<p>John Mackay watched the sun set with unusual interest, possibly
because he did not expect to see it rise again. &ldquo;The attack will
come soon now,&rdquo; he remarked to the serjeant, who was endeavouring
to smoke, despite his parched mouth.</p>
<p>The little man nodded. &ldquo;Yes, Senor. I, for one, am glad I went
to Mass last Sunday. There was a girl who asked me to meet her
afterwards&rdquo;; then, for the fiftieth time, he tried the action of
his carbine&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The head-hunters have them in the big shack. They will kill
them all soon after sunset.&rdquo; There was a perfectly matter-of-fact
ring in the messenger&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Felizardo knit his brows. He had given certain orders to the
head-hunters, and he was not used to being disobeyed; moreover, he had
a very kindly feeling towards John Mackay, who had once done him a good
turn; consequently, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"
name="pb131">131</a>]</span>he did not share the messenger&rsquo;s
cheerful frame of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you at the outpost doing, that you allow
this?&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;You know the orders I have given to
those savages, to leave all Englishmen alone. I suppose they think
that, because I left them unpunished last time, I shall do the same
again. Go down now, at once, and tell Manuel to make them withdraw, and
then go to the Constabulario at Silang, and tell the Captain to come
and fetch Senor Mackay and the fat fool away. Of course, you will tell
the Captain you come from me. What else would you say? I can trust
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result was that dawn found the little garrison, half-dead with
thirst, but still awaiting the attack; and an hour after dawn John
Mackay caught sight of Captain Hayle&rsquo;s tall figure coming through
the trees, with thirty of his men at his heels.</p>
<p>When Mr Gobbitt had swallowed a quart or so of water, followed by
some brandy, his courage began to revive. &ldquo;I told you we should
be all right,&rdquo; he said peevishly to Mackay; &ldquo;I never
thought they were in earnest&rdquo;; then he remembered the two
carriers, slain in his presence, and that ghastly head, and he went a
little pale, though the shuddering had ceased.</p>
<p>They buried the heads&mdash;a useless formality, for the
head-hunters unearthed them within a few hours&mdash;and then Basil
Hayle escorted the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132"
name="pb132">132</a>]</span>party back to his stockade, to rest for a
day or two. That evening, whilst Mr Gobbitt was having a much-needed
wash and change, Mackay turned suddenly to his host. &ldquo;By the way,
I&rsquo;ve got a message for you from Mrs Bush. She says she is very
well, and hears of you often through the natives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil did not look up from the cigar he was cutting. &ldquo;Thanks
very much,&rdquo; he said briefly.</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt felt much better after the evening meal, so much better,
in fact, that he could discuss matters calmly. &ldquo;And did you know
anything of the fate of my late partner&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; Hayle answered promptly.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they tell you in Manila? It was before I came to
this side of the range; but Lieutenant Stott at Catarman told me, and I
saw the copy of the report he sent to the Commission. He asked
permission to hunt those savages down, but he never got any reply. Oh,
all the Commissioners knew, and I supposed it had been made
public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant got up suddenly and began to pace the rather rickety
floor. &ldquo;I see it now,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;I see it all.
Either I am to buy this land which no one else will look at, because of
these abominable persons who tried to take my head; or else I shall not
come back at all, and they will keep the deposit. I will lay the matter
before the Consul&mdash;no, I will lay it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>before the Foreign
Office. I will have compensation. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he
spluttered with rage.</p>
<p>Mackay winked at Basil, who smiled in return, unseen by the
merchant, who went on. &ldquo;It is scandalous, an outrage. I can see
how I have been misled. They say the Islands are at peace; and yet two
men are killed actually in my presence, and no arrests are made. Whilst
the head of my late partner&rsquo;s son is used as a trophy!
Abominable! Even in Igut, when I wished to summons the owners of those
most offensive pigs, they laughed at me. Which is my quickest way back
to Manila?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through Catarman,&rdquo; Basil answered. &ldquo;That is the
route you should have come, only in that case Stott would have told you
of Mr Dunk&rsquo;s death. Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt&rsquo;s first visit in Manila was to the Consulate, when
he demanded to see the Acting-Consul instantly. The Consul received him
without effusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had a good time in the bush, Mr Gobbitt? You look a bit
thinner&mdash;yes, a lot thinner. What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a long story,&rdquo; Mr Gobbitt began; whereupon the
Acting-Consul put his feet on the table, and selected an extra large
cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away,&rdquo; he said; but before the merchant had got
very far the cigar had been allowed to go out, and the official was all
attention. When it was finished, he drew a deep breath. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>&ldquo;You had a lucky escape, a very lucky
escape;&rdquo; there was no levity in his voice now. &ldquo;But you
must admit that I warned you against Gumpertz. And I am afraid we can
do nothing in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? What are you here for then, sir?&rdquo; It was the voice
of the British tax-payer talking to his employ&eacute;.</p>
<p>The Consul explained patiently. &ldquo;As regards the negotiations.
You were alone, were you not? Yes, your word, the word of an unknown
man&mdash;pardon me, I mean unknown in America&mdash;against that of a
high official. And I take it&mdash;I must speak plainly&mdash;you
offered something in the nature of a bribe. You did? A present.&rdquo;
He smiled a little grimly. &ldquo;The price asked shows that, and it
comes to the same thing. Graft, they call it here. That fact destroys
your case at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt breathed heavily. &ldquo;And how about my deposit of six
thousand dollars? The receipt is at the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then ask the bank to collect it,&rdquo; answered the Consul;
&ldquo;they may succeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May succeed, sir! They must succeed.&rdquo; Again there was
the British tax-payer note.</p>
<p>The Consul smiled. &ldquo;We will say we hope they succeed. Still,
after your other experiences&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had the old boy this time, Blackiston,&rdquo;
the Consul said to the Vice-Consul, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>the visitor had
departed. &ldquo;Proper murder trick. Seems to have shaken his nerves
badly. It would have shaken mine, too.
Head-hunters&mdash;ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vice-Consul closed the letter-book wearily. &ldquo;Serve him
right. He shouldn&rsquo;t be so cock-sure and pompous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the senior clerks from the bank took the receipt of
Commissioner Gumpertz to the Palace, presently returning with a grave
face. &ldquo;They know nothing about any such sum, sir; and it is
neither a regular official receipt, nor is it the Commissioner&rsquo;s
signature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt gasped. &ldquo;Why, he gave it to me himself! There must
be some mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk shook his head. &ldquo;They are positive, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see him sign it?&rdquo; the manager asked, a little
coldly.</p>
<p>The merchant mopped the perspiration off his forehead. &ldquo;No, I
cannot say I did. He went into another room. But your cashier can
identify the messenger&mdash;one of those belonging to the
Palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the cashier came, he remembered the incident perfectly.
&ldquo;It was a large sum, and I should not have handed it to a strange
native; but I knew the porter at the hotel was reliable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the last straw, so far as Mr Gobbitt was concerned.
&ldquo;They have swindled me out <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136"
href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>of twelve hundred
pounds,&rdquo; he groaned, fanning himself with his handkerchief the
while; then a thought struck him. &ldquo;You have the numbers of the
notes? You can trace them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager looked doubtful. &ldquo;Some, perhaps. We will do our
best. Come in again to-morrow, Mr Gobbitt. Meanwhile, if I were you, I
should say nothing, and stay indoors. You need rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning, the merchant found the bank manager very cold and
distant in his manner. &ldquo;We have traced several of the
notes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In each case they have come from most
questionable places&mdash;places of no repute, in fact. I presume you
have witnesses to prove where you were that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in my room at the hotel. I went to bed very early, as I
was starting early next morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; There was no mistaking the tone. &ldquo;So no one
saw you after dinner. That is a pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Gobbitt brought his hand down on the table with a thump.
&ldquo;Do you mean to insinuate, sir, that I myself passed those notes
at those infamous places? Never in my life&rdquo;&mdash;he had
forgotten Igut&mdash;&ldquo;never in my life was I in one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to insinuate nothing,&rdquo; the manager answered
wearily. &ldquo;Only you cannot prove that you were not out, and, if
you make a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>fuss, the Commissioners will quickly prove that
you were. They will get police, native officials, and perhaps even a
native judge or two, to remember having met you. You can do nothing,
and I can do nothing, and, if you will excuse me, I am very busy.
Good-morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil Hayle spent several hours in drawing up a report concerning Mr
Gobbitt, the head-hunters, and Felizardo, then he read it through
again, and straightway destroyed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The less said, the better,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never believe anything to the old man&rsquo;s
credit, and they might shift me over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, instead of sending the report, he marched out by night to the
head-hunters&rsquo; village, hoping to catch them there; but only found
the ashes of the houses, and had one of his men wounded by a spear
thrown in the darkness. Then he went back to his stockade at Silang,
where he sat down, and thought of Felizardo and of Captain Bush, and
most of all of Mrs Bush, and cursed at the dreary inaction, and prayed
that the ladrones would come along and give him a fight. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">HOW THEY REBUILT THE GALLOWS AT CALOCAN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">During the two months following Mr Gobbitt&rsquo;s
adventure, things were very quiet in the neighbourhood of
Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains. The old outlaw kept to his policy of
trying to avoid trouble by acting strictly on the defensive; and, as
neither Captain Bush nor Captain Hayle received orders to make an
attack, during the whole of that time not a shot was fired in anger,
and Captain Bush&rsquo;s Scouts grew so fat and soft, and got so
completely out of hand, that they were hardly fit to do even one
day&rsquo;s work in the field&mdash;unlike Hayle&rsquo;s Constabulary
at Silang, who had much less to eat and were given much more to do,
which was good, both for them and for the service.</p>
<p>In Manila, however, neither Commissioner Furber nor the late members
of the Provisional Government had forgotten Felizardo. The Commissioner
was smarting over the failure of his plans. The ex-insurrecto generals
and colonels <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>had not forgiven the old chief, who, besides
refusing help at a critical juncture, had also hanged ignominiously an
envoy of the Sovereign People. Consequently, having the ear of the
Commissioner, they lost no opportunity of relating the evil deeds of
Felizardo; and when their imaginations failed them, they ascribed to
him some of their own abominable doings during the rebellion. Mr Furber
believed it all&mdash;were they not his Little Brown
Brothers?&mdash;and he found an ally in Commissioner Gumpertz, who also
had reason for feeling sore against Felizardo; but one or two of the
other Commissioners shook their heads. &ldquo;What harm does the old
man do?&rdquo; they asked. &ldquo;As it is, we have to waste enough
money on active ladrones, and a small war of this kind would not leave
much balance&rdquo;&mdash;which, being interpreted, meant &ldquo;much
to be divided amongst the faithful supporters of the Party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Commissioner Furber had to give way, for a time at least; and the
ex-generals and colonels gnashed their teeth with rage, for, in
addition to the old scores, they had one or two new plans, the
preliminaries to a fresh insurrection, which might be nipped in the bud
if Felizardo came to hear of them, as he probably would do. So they put
their heads together, smoking many cigarettes and drinking much spirit
during secret conclaves in closely-shuttered old houses in the Walled
City&mdash;which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140"
name="pb140">140</a>]</span>is the name for Old Manila&mdash;and at
last they evolved a scheme which seemed to them excellent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will set the Americanos against Felizardo,&rdquo; they
said. &ldquo;Nothing enrages them so much as to have their women
carried off. Then there will be a long and expensive war in the
mountains, with the loss of many men; and our doings will not be
noticed&mdash;until we are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they appointed a committee, including, amongst others, Senor
Guiterrez, Mr Furber&rsquo;s secretary, and Senor Vagas, an assistant
collector of Customs, brother-in-law to Chief Collector Sharler, and
Senor Talibat, the judge; and, after that, they dispersed, in great
good-humour, feeling sure that, before many months had passed, they
would once more be wearing large red epaulettes and large red sashes,
and trailing huge cavalry sabres behind them.</p>
<p>However, you cannot arrange matters of such grave national
importance in a few days; consequently, weeks went by before anything
could be attempted in the Islands themselves. There were funds to be
collected and sent to other Brown Brothers in Hong Kong, who, after
taking as much as they thought would not be noticed&mdash;patriots are
never greedy&mdash;handed the balance to certain discreet Chinamen,
wherewith to purchase certain articles, which, packed in small and
convenient cases and crates, were presently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>put
on board the German steamer <i>Bertha Helwig</i> and dispatched to
Manila.</p>
<p>Chief Collector Sharler was a young man with a clean-shaven face,
gold-rimmed spectacles, and ideas. It is the latter only which are
really important so far as this story is concerned. His appearance
certainly suited his theories; but had he been gross and
sensual-looking like Mr Gumpertz, or lean and wolfish like Mr Furber,
and still held those same theories, the result would have been the
same.</p>
<p>The Chief Collector had come out from the United States full of
ardour for the cause of the Filipino victims of Spanish tyranny. When I
said he had ideas, perhaps I was wrong; certainly, I understated the
case. He had obsessions, the chief of which was the doctrine of Racial
Equality, which may be quite harmless when practised in a small
American city, where there is no native problem, but becomes positively
and actively dangerous when preached in the Tropics. Another obsession
of his, a very strange one in the eyes of his colleagues, was his
objection to all forms of corruption, a doctrine which is admirable
everywhere, and practised in very few places.</p>
<p>Mr Sharler had not been in the Islands long before he showed his
faith in the first of his theories by marrying a mestiza, the sister of
Enrique Vagas, then one of the junior clerks in his office. It cannot
be said that this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>practical demonstration of his principles
was welcome, even to those other heads of the Civil Service who had
been the loudest in their praise of the &ldquo;Little Brown
Brother&rdquo; policy of the Governor-General. It made things awkward
with their own wives, they said; whilst, as for the Army, orders were
given to the porters of the Military Club that no one was to be
permitted to bring Mr Sharler into the building again as a guest. The
result of all this was that the Chief Collector went more and more into
the society of his wife&rsquo;s own people, and became more and more
rabid on the subject of Racial Equality, discovering in his new
relatives virtues which they themselves, even in their wildest moments,
had never imagined they possessed&mdash;such as truthfulness, for
instance.</p>
<p>The other white members of the Customs staff encouraged their Chief
in his obsession, and all those who had not actually got their white
wives on the spot went through forms of marriage with mestizas;
moreover, the Chief&rsquo;s earnestness on this question left him less
time for translating his other theory, his objection to graft, into
practice, so for a time things went very smoothly, and bank balances
grew at a most pleasant rate. Then, one day, Enrique Vagas, having been
soundly and deservedly kicked by an irate white chief assistant,
suddenly remembered many instances of corruption, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>and
straightway related them to his brother-in-law and superior officer.
After the enquiry, there was a considerable number of vacancies, and
what was more natural and fitting than that Enrique Vagas, and those
other incorruptible Brown Brothers who had helped him track the
offenders, should be promoted to the posts? From that time onwards,
whatever the importers might say, matters went smoothly in the office.
The Chief Collector heard not a single rumour of graft now, save from
interested parties outside, and, so convinced was he of the integrity
and loyalty of everybody, that more than once, at the suggestion of
Vagas, he attempted to secure the withdrawal of those officious and
useless military detectives who were detailed to watch for smuggled
arms. But on that point he failed signally. &ldquo;We have had some
before,&rdquo; the General answered curtly.
&ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By a curious coincidence, the <i>Bertha Helwig</i> happened to
arrive early on the morning of a public holiday. It was equally curious
that Senor Vagas had arranged an outing for that day. One of the large
Customs launches was to convey a party, of which the Chief Collector
was to be a member, to a charming spot some fifteen miles away, where
everybody would land and have lunch, and afterwards talk of Equality
and the Rights of the People.</p>
<p>When the other guests assembled on the quay, they found Senor Vagas
in the highest spirits. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>&ldquo;Congratulate me,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;My <i>fianc&eacute;e</i> has returned on that steamer, the
<i>Bertha Helwig</i>. We will fetch her, and some other friends of mine
who are aboard, and take them with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief Collector beamed through his glasses. &ldquo;It was a good
idea,&rdquo; he said, and ordered the launch to go alongside the German
steamer. As they went out&mdash;the <i>Bertha Helwig</i> was some
distance from the shore&mdash;they passed close to the police boat,
whose captain, seeing the Chief Collector in the other craft, paid no
more attention to her and her doings, as was but natural, and very
convenient for Senor Vagas, who would have been watched had he been
alone, and would have been stopped had he headed away up the bay when
he left the <i>Bertha Helwig</i>.</p>
<p>As it was, there was plenty of time to transfer all those cases and
crates, which the discreet Chinaman in Hong Kong had shipped, from the
steamer to the launch, whilst the Chief Collector was in the little
saloon, going through a series of introductions, and drinking the beer
of the Fatherland with the skipper. By the time he came on deck again,
everything had been stowed out of sight on the launch, which then made
her way to the appointed landing place. The next transfer of those
cases took place a couple of hours later, whilst the party was lunching
in a charming little banana grove, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145"
href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>about half a mile away. This
transhipment, like the other, did not take long. Two large dug-outs
appeared from out of what was apparently an impenetrable mangrove
swamp, took the cases aboard, and in the space of a few minutes had
vanished again down the narrow passage from which they had emerged.
Later on, when their crews opened those cases and crates in the
moonlight, they unpacked a hundred small-bore rifles, and many
thousands of rounds of ammunition, a fact which goes to prove the
statement that Mr Sharler&rsquo;s views were a danger to the
community.</p>
<p>Neither Basil Hayle nor Captain Bush had any system of Intelligence
worth mentioning; and, as their official reports were the only source
of information the authorities had, it follows that the latter knew as
little, less perhaps, than they did of what was happening in that part
of the Island. True, each of the officers did his best according to his
lights&mdash;rather dim lights in the case of Captain Bush&mdash;but
the results obtained were quite out of proportion to the trouble taken,
because nineteen statements out of every twenty collected were untrue,
and the twentieth was usually valueless. Practically every native in
the district was in sympathy with the old insurrecto party, or else was
one of Felizardo&rsquo;s agents; consequently, it was absurd to blame
either of the officers for not hearing of the landing of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>guns, or for not being forewarned concerning the
schemes of Senor Vagas and his fellow-patriots.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Felizardo heard about the guns, and sent fifty of
his best bolomen to try and borrow them; but they were just too late,
for when they reached the town of San Francisco, which is some fifteen
miles inland from Igut, the weapons were already stored in the house of
the Presidente, who was a former member of the Provisional Government,
and a cousin of the wife of Chief Collector Sharler. Felizardo had
forbidden his men to make an attack on any of the towns, so they were
compelled to leave the guns alone; but they had a little compensation,
for they came on two ex-members of the band, who had deserted to the
insurrectos, and these they hanged during the night, on the great
timber belfry in the middle of the plaza, facing the Presidente&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>Felizardo paid well for information, and he usually eliminated those
who played him false; consequently, he was not long in obtaining an
insight into the plans of the patriots. Men of his, who had been with
him for years, said they had never before seen him so angry. Even
Dolores Lasara was unable to calm him down. For half a day he sat
alone, smoking innumerable cigarettes, and thinking out schemes of
revenge; then suddenly he came back to the camp, apparently calm, and
gave his orders. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147"
name="pb147">147</a>]</span>There were to be outposts all round San
Francisco and its neighbourhood, and a chain of boudjon-blowers to pass
any alarm back to the mountains, and another chain across the pass, up
to Basil Hayle&rsquo;s stockade at Silang, where the last man was to
have a letter ready to deliver to the Constabulary officer as soon as
he heard the warning notes on the horns. Then the old chief himself,
with fifty of his best men, all of whom had rifles as well as bolos,
shifted down to the outpost nearest to Igut, and waited patiently for
the maturing of the scheme of Senor Vagas of the Customs, and Senor
Guiterrez the secretary to Mr Furber, and Senor Talibat the judge, each
of whom would probably have taken the first steamer to Hong Kong, had
he known of the plans of this Enemy of the Sovereign People.</p>
<p>Basil Hayle was sitting in his quarters within the stockade,
reading, when he caught the sound of a boudjon&mdash;faint, two miles
away perhaps, but perfectly distinct. He put his book down quickly, and
went out on to the platform of the stockade, where he found the
Serjeant of the guard listening intently. A minute later, another
boudjon sounded, very loud and clear, within a few hundred yards this
time, evidently answering the other.</p>
<p>Basil and the Serjeant exchanged glances. This was the first hint of
anything in the nature of hostilities they had received since Mr
Gobbitt&rsquo;s adventure with the head-hunters. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty close, that,&rdquo; the Captain said.</p>
<p>The serjeant nodded. &ldquo;Yes, Senor. But it does not mean an
attack. They would not warn us beforehand in that way. Possibly, it
means a message. We shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, his prediction was justified, for a
native, an ordinary tao by his dress, strolled up to the gate of the
stockade, announced that he had a letter for the Senor in command of
the Constabulario, delivered the envelope to the corporal of the guard,
then, without another word, strolled back into the bush.</p>
<p>The corporal lingered a few moments, until the expression on
Basil&rsquo;s face told him what he wanted to know. &ldquo;The cooks
might hurry on the dinner,&rdquo; he said, as he got back to the little
guard-house; &ldquo;we shall be going out. It was from Felizardo. I
recognised the messenger. He was in the fight on the hillside.&rdquo;
And, having the first information, he set to work to borrow as many
cigarettes as possible, so as to be well supplied for the march.</p>
<p>Basil read the note once, rapidly; then re-read it very carefully,
and immediately made up his mind. It ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Senor Felizardo, Chief of the Mountains,
sends a greeting to the Chief of the Constabulario. This morning a band
of a hundred men, all formerly of the foolish insurrecto army, started
from the neighbourhood of San Francisco. At dawn to-morrow morning they
will burn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>Igut. They wish it to be thought in Manila that
the Senor Felizardo has done this thing, so that the Government will
send an army against him, and, meanwhile, they will be able to prepare
another rebellion, unobserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Captain of the Constabulario marches quickly, he may
take them in the rear. His stockade at Silang will be safe, on the word
of Felizardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wish to kill all at Igut, save the Senora, who is
promised to one Juan Vagas, the leader, brother to Enrique Vagas in the
Customs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then followed a brief supplementary note on the way in which the
rifles had been introduced.</p>
<p>Basil Hayle did not hesitate. Had it been his first experience of
Felizardo, he would have feared a trap. As it was, however, no
suspicion of that kind entered his mind. All he thought about now was
to be in time, to take those insurrectos in the rear, just as they were
attacking, and himself to kill Juan Vagas. He was more like a wild
beast than a man when he thought of what Felizardo really
meant&mdash;but a dangerously quiet wild beast, one which means to
kill. The Law of the Bolo had come into his life now, fully, absolutely
displacing all other rules of conduct. There was to be no quarter this
time, as he told the serjeant, who grinned in great appreciation.</p>
<p>In little over twenty minutes the column had started, leaving only
five sick men in the stockade. So far as the latter was concerned,
Basil trusted to Felizardo&rsquo;s word. He could not spare enough men
to defend it, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>so he decided, very wisely, to leave it
undefended.</p>
<p>They wasted no time on the road, and before sundown they were across
the pass, where they found a solitary boloman seated on a large rock,
apparently awaiting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the guide,&rdquo; he said briefly. &ldquo;There is a
short cut. The ladrones passed down two hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most men would have called Basil Hayle a rash fool when he nodded
and said: &ldquo;Very well. Lead on;&rdquo; but it was a question of
taking risks, or of allowing the promise to Juan Vagas to be kept.</p>
<p>They halted once, and once only, during the night, and then it was
at the suggestion of the guide. &ldquo;We shall be in time,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;the soldiers might rest a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men threw themselves down, and smoked and chattered in
undertones about the great killing they were going to do; but Captain
Basil Hayle stalked up and down, chewing fiercely on the end of his
cigar.</p>
<p>After a while, the guide spoke again. &ldquo;We should be going now.
One thing first, though. Tell your soldiers that the ladrones all have
rifles, and are dressed in blue, like Felizardo&rsquo;s men usually
are. Possibly, however, there will be bolomen dressed in white come out
of the jungle to help you. Tell your men, so that they will
know.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>The little soldiers grinned, understanding who those bolomen would
be. &ldquo;He, the old chief, might be there himself,&rdquo; they
whispered to one another. &ldquo;Who knows? We might even see
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half a mile from Igut, the guide brought them back into the main
road. &ldquo;They have passed already,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the
spoor.</p>
<p>They went on very cautiously then, for there was just the faintest
hint of dawn in the east, and they knew it was only a question of a few
minutes before the attack would begin; in fact, had the patriots been
bolomen, it would have begun already, but it is different when you have
rifles.</p>
<p>The enemy had no rear guard, partially because they had no thought
of being attacked, partially because each man was so anxious for his
share of the glory and of the loot. Consequently, Basil Hayle was quite
close behind them when they entered the plaza and slew the sleeping
Scout sentry&mdash;so close, in fact, that his men managed to get a
most telling volley into the crowd of patriots bunched in the gateway
of the barracks.</p>
<p>After that, it did not take very long. True, half a dozen Scouts
were killed before the rest could awaken and start shooting; but the
sudden attack from behind had paralysed the patriots, and, after the
second volley from Hayle&rsquo;s little men, they broke and fled. It
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>then that those bolomen in white appeared,
seemingly from nowhere, at the corners of the plaza, and got to work
quietly.</p>
<p>Basil Hayle stood in the middle of the plaza, repeating shot-gun in
hand, wondering whether by any chance Juan Vagas had been trapped in
the barracks. He had no orders to give his men&mdash;he had given the
only one necessary immediately after the last volley&mdash;&ldquo;No
quarter&rdquo;&mdash;and he knew that the fight, if fight it could be
called, had passed clean out of his control. It was getting light now,
and he looked round towards the Bushes&rsquo; house&mdash;the house he
had saved&mdash;and saw a white-clad figure standing on the balcony,
watching him.</p>
<p>Instantly, he forgot everything, even Juan Vagas, and ran across the
plaza. Mrs Bush gripped the balcony to steady herself.
&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You! Thank God! What is it all?
Oh, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told her in a few brief sentences. &ldquo;I was only just in
time,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>They were still killing patriots at the lower end of the plaza,
Constabulary and Felizardo&rsquo;s men in white working together. She
gave one glance in that direction, then covered her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are those in white, and the man on the grey
horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was light enough now to see fairly distinctly, and Basil realised
at once who the little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href=
"#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>horseman, calmly smoking a
cigarette, watching the killing, must be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Felizardo himself,&rdquo; he said; then, thinking the
other was looking, he raised his hand in salute. Instantly, the
broad-brimmed hat was swept off in reply. Captain Hayle turned round
quickly; they had seen one another now, as friends; and he must not
know officially that the outlaw was there. When he looked round again,
the killing was finished; the Constabulary were collecting together the
weapons of the fallen; and both grey horse and white-clad bolomen had
disappeared as suddenly as they had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Hayle, have you seen my husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil started. &ldquo;No, I never thought&mdash;Oh, there he
is,&rdquo; as the Scout officer came hurrying up one of the streets,
accompanied by three more breathless white men.</p>
<p>Hayle went to meet them. &ldquo;Mighty close shave, Captain,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>Bush looked at him with wild eyes. &ldquo;What is it all?
What&rsquo;s happened? What are you doing here? I was in the
Treasurer&rsquo;s&mdash;we had been playing cards late&mdash;when we
heard the shooting, and saw the streets full of bolomen. I suppose this
is Felizardo&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Basil answered curtly; he had
detected the lie. &ldquo;It was the old insurrecto gang. If I had been
ten minutes later they would have wiped out Igut;&rdquo; and he gave
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>other a brief outline of what had occurred,
omitting all mention of Felizardo.</p>
<p>Bush flushed. &ldquo;I reckon my men would have put up a
fight,&rdquo; he said ungraciously, whereupon Basil turned on his heel
and left him. Already, the serjeant had reported that, though there
were five dead insurrectos in the barracks, there were six dead Scouts,
not including the sentry; though the Constabulary had only lost one
man, and Felizardo had lost none.</p>
<p>Whilst Bush was going up to the barracks, Basil glanced towards the
balcony again; but Mrs Bush had disappeared. Still, he had the
knowledge that he had saved her, and, what was better still, he had the
memory of her grateful look.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it struck him that he was deadly weary. They had been
marching since midday the previous day, and it was now about six in the
morning, doing a forced march through jungle, without stopping to cook
food. He leaned against the timbers of the belfry and beckoned to the
serjeant, who was examining a small-bore rifle he had captured.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the bugler anywhere, serjeant; but get the men
together, and tell them all to pile their arms here and dismiss. They
must be hungry and tired, and the Scouts can do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serjeant grinned. &ldquo;We have left no &lsquo;rest&rsquo; for
them to do, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not very dignified to be leaning against <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>one
of the posts of the belfry, so Basil tried to stand up erect, whilst
waiting for his men; but the sudden relaxation of the strain had left
him a little dazed, and, almost unconsciously, he sat down on the
ground, with his shot-gun across his knees and his head forward. The
thought which had kept him up so far, the memory of Mrs Bush&rsquo;s
look, had now been replaced by another, which drummed through his brain
with maddening persistency&mdash;&ldquo;Why had Bush himself been
allowed to escape?&rdquo; A stray shot, a chance slash with a bolo,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Hayle, what do you mean by this? Come into the house
at once. You must be absolutely done up after that awful march from
Silang.&rdquo; Basil felt a hand laid gently on his shoulder, and
scrambled to his feet at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Bush! Oh, I&rsquo;m all right, really, but tired, you
know.&rdquo; Even her touch had not quite cleared his mind yet, then,
with an effort, he pulled himself together. &ldquo;I am waiting for my
men, and I am afraid I was almost asleep. No, I don&rsquo;t think I
will come in. Captain Bush seemed a little annoyed, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bush looked him square in the eyes. &ldquo;Captain Hayle, I ask
whom I think fit into my house. You will come now. You know your men
can look after themselves. I have already sent word to Ah Lung to let
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>have what they want. The Scouts can guard
Igut&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed her in without a word. First she brought him brandy and
soda water; and then she glanced at his torn and muddy uniform, and his
soaking boots, one of which was minus a heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you in those,&rdquo; she said suddenly. &ldquo;They
tell me&mdash;they tell me&mdash;many things. Only, you must change. I
will put some other clothes in the spare room for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he came out again, dressed in a white suit of Captain
Bush&rsquo;s, she had some breakfast ready for him, but he could not
touch it for sheer weariness; whereupon she made a couch for him on one
of the long cane sofas in the drawing-room, and then she left him.
Within a couple of minutes he was fast asleep. Mrs Bush opened the door
quietly, looked in, went on tiptoe to his side, and, stooping down,
kissed his hair lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you did it for me, dearest,&rdquo; she murmured; then
she went out, just as her husband came into the house, accompanied by
the Treasurer and the Supervisor. They were talking loudly, and did not
appear to notice Mrs Bush until she spoke. &ldquo;Please be more
quiet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Captain Hayle is asleep in the
drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Treasurer and the Supervisor exchanged sheepish glances, but
Bush flushed. &ldquo;I never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>asked him in here.&rdquo; Then he
was sorry he had spoken, for her answer came, cutting like a lash:
&ldquo;I asked him. But for him, none of us would be asking any one
anywhere now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were the Scouts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; her husband began,
but she did not let him finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Scouts! And where was the Scout officer, and the other
white heroes, who would have saved Igut?&rdquo; She turned away
scornfully and swept upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Bush, we had better get out; we aren&rsquo;t exactly
welcome. The Virginian seems to be first favourite.&rdquo; The
Supervisor was already moving towards the door, when Captain Bush
stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay here. This is my house, and if I want to ask you in
for a drink, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But both the others declined. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d sooner not. She may
come back. And the spirit shop&rsquo;s open now.&rdquo; So, in the end,
Bush had to give way; and, instead of seeing to his wounded, and
investigating the whole affair, sat drinking himself into a sodden
state, and listening to the vile insinuations of his civilian friends.
There was no gratitude to Basil Hayle for having saved the lives of all
of them, only bitter jealousy and resentment, coupled with a little
fear, at least on the part of the civil officials, who, on the occasion
of his former visit, had heard his candid opinion concerning the lives
they led. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, out on the plaza the serjeant and half a dozen men were
keeping guard over four prisoners. The rest of the Constabulary were
scattered. Some were still feeding in Ah Lung&rsquo;s store, some were
sitting in the shade of the belfry smoking, but most had drifted away
in search of sleeping places. But the serjeant and his little guard
remained, for they had received those four prisoners from no less a
person than Felizardo himself, who had handed them over with the words:
&ldquo;Tell your captain these must be hanged.&rdquo; And the serjeant,
who had been in the Spanish Service, had saluted, and had taken his
prizes to the plaza, and trussed them up securely, and then had sat
down to wait until it should please his captain to reappear. He knew
who those prisoners were. One was Juan Vagas himself, whilst the other
three had been majors in the insurrecto army.</p>
<p>Presently there came along the Presidente and many tao, with carts
drawn by water-buffalo, and started collecting the dead. Eighty-one
they found out of the hundred who had come in&mdash;which, as the
serjeant said, was a good killing. And when that task was finished the
Presidente chanced to notice those four trussed-up prisoners beside the
belfry, and came to inspect them; but when he saw their faces he seemed
to shiver a little, and a quick glance passed between him and Juan
Vagas. Then he spoke <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"
name="pb159">159</a>]</span>in the voice which had so often made the
tao themselves shiver, and pay fines without asking for receipts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing with those men? If they are prisoners, why
have you not handed them over to me, so that I can put them in gaol? I
will send my police for them at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the serjeant cared for no Presidentes; moreover, he had seen
that glance of recognition between Juan Vagas and the official.
&ldquo;These are the prisoners of the Constabulary,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They remain here until I receive orders from my
captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Presidente used unofficial language. &ldquo;I will send my
police for them,&rdquo; he retorted, and departed, storming.</p>
<p>When the serjeant saw a dozen or so ragged civil police approaching,
he nodded to his men. &ldquo;Load,&rdquo; he said curtly, and the
police halted forthwith.</p>
<p>Once more, the Presidente came forward; it was a matter of
absolutely vital importance for him to get possession of those
prisoners, even if, as was possible, they did happen to escape during
the night. &ldquo;Where is your captain?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>The serjeant pointed with his revolver towards the Bushes&rsquo;
house. &ldquo;In there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Presidente bit his lip. He was not really anxious to meet Basil
Hayle, and he was much less anxious to meet Mrs Bush; so, as a
compromise, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>he went to the spirit shop to consult Captain
Bush, who did not receive him cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I got to do with it?&rdquo; the Scout growled.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a soldier, not a forsaken police-man like Hayle. If I
had taken them, I should have shot them out of hand, to save the
trouble of hanging them. Are they friends or relatives of yours?&rdquo;
Usually he and the Presidente were on very good terms, but to-day his
nerves were shaken. He knew he deserved, and might possibly get, his
dismissal from the Service&mdash;that is, if Basil Hayle told the whole
truth.</p>
<p>He had got to go to Basil Hayle and ask his forbearance&mdash;that
was the most bitter thought of all. He was completely in the hands of
this Constabulary officer, whom, perhaps, he hated more than any other
man living. They could not blame him for not knowing that the attack
was coming, but they could, and would, blame him for not being prepared
for an attack; whilst, if they learnt that he had been one of the last
men on the scene&mdash;&mdash; He made a grimace at the thought.</p>
<p>It was midday when Basil awakened, wondering at first where he could
be; then, as he looked round, he remembered suddenly. A few minutes
later Mrs Bush came in. &ldquo;You look better now,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You were dreadfully tired this morning. You ought to have
something to eat, though, before you go out. One of your serjeants has
been asking for you; and I have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>been watching the Presidente
stalking up and down in front of the house like a maniac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;They can wait,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I really am hungry now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst he was eating, he gave her a few more details of the
night&rsquo;s adventure. &ldquo;It was Felizardo who really saved
you,&rdquo; he said, whereat she shook her head. &ldquo;Yes, it
was,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;But for him, I should still have been at
that dreary hole, Silang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it very dreary?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He looked away. &ldquo;Of course it was. I never hated a place so
much in my life. You see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off suddenly,
and for a few minutes there was silence; then he got up rather
abruptly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me now, I must see what the
serjeant wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he went out, the Presidente stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I speak to you a moment, Captain?&rdquo; the official
began, but Basil cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a few minutes. I must see to my men first. I&rsquo;ll
come to your office, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serjeant grinned as he saluted. &ldquo;I wanted to see you about
those, Senor,&rdquo; jerking his thumb in the direction of his
prisoners. &ldquo;I received them from&mdash;from the Chief of the
Mountains himself. He said they must be hanged. One is Juan Vagas, and
the other three are his chief lieutenants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil drew a quick breath. Juan Vagas! So he had him, after all. He
strode over to them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162"
name="pb162">162</a>]</span>and, when Juan Vagas saw the look in his
face, he knew that there would be no escape this time.</p>
<p>The serjeant, who was standing beside Captain Hayle, nodded with a
kind of grim satisfaction. &ldquo;Doubtless they will rebuild the
gallows at Calocan now, Senor. You do not remember the old ones on
which they hanged Cinicio Dagujob and his friends many years ago, when
I first came to this island from Samar. I was only a little boy then,
but I can recall how this same Felizardo, who is now in the mountains,
fought the ladrones behind old Don Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s warehouse, and
how the old corporal of the Guardia <span class="corr" id="xd25e1861"
title="Source: Civile">Civil</span> had to hurry on the hanging of
those Felizardo had wounded. Without question, these ladrones here will
meet Cinicio in purgatory, somewhere near the big fire.&rdquo; Then he
drew his officer to one side and spoke very gravely. &ldquo;Senor, the
Presidente has been trying to get the prisoners. I had to tell the men
to load with ball cartridge. That Vagas is a friend of the
Presidente&rsquo;s, and if they got them into the gaol there would be
an escape to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Basil nodded; he realised now that this
attack on Igut was only a part of a widespread conspiracy against
American rule, and the moment he had seen the prisoners he had decided
himself to take them into Manila, and fight the question out there.
&ldquo;I understand, serjeant,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;They are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>to be delivered to no one without my orders.
Where is Serjeant Reyes? Tell him to get ten men and take the prisoners
into that shed at the back of Ah Lung&rsquo;s store. You and these
other men had better go and get some rest now. I will see the
Presidente myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Presidente was pacing up and down his room when Basil entered.
The Constabulary officer wasted no words. &ldquo;I hear you have
demanded those prisoners, Senor. By what authority do you threaten my
men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The official stuttered a little. &ldquo;I&mdash;I represent the
civil arm, Senor, and these&mdash;these ladrones should be lodged in
gaol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil laughed in a rather disconcerting fashion. &ldquo;I, too,
represent the Civil Government,&rdquo; he retorted; &ldquo;and I am
going to take those prisoners into Manila. I have heard of escapes from
Igut Gaol.&rdquo; His tone suddenly became severe, almost fierce.
&ldquo;Take care, Senor. Be very careful. I am inclined to carry you
along with me as a prisoner too. Probably I shall come for you later,
unless you can clear yourself meanwhile. And now you will send to the
gaol for four sets of irons, and have them delivered, without delay, to
Serjeant Reyes, in the shed at the back of Ah Lung&rsquo;s
store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Presidente gave the order with shivering reluctance; then Basil
seated himself at the table, in the official&rsquo;s own chair.
&ldquo;Have you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164"
name="pb164">164</a>]</span>a return of the dead found this morning?
Let me see it.&rdquo; But the moment he set eyes on the document, he
tore it across. &ldquo;You head it &lsquo;List of Felizardo&rsquo;s
brigands killed by the Town Police, the Scouts, and the
Constabulary&rsquo;!&rdquo; he stormed. &ldquo;How dare you! You know
as well as I do that they were insurrectos, and nothing whatever to do
with Felizardo. As for your Town Police and Scouts&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He laughed scornfully. &ldquo;And now make me out a proper return and
sign it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, half an hour later, Captain Hayle took his leave, he left a
sad and perspiring Presidente behind him, one who had reached the point
of wondering whether it would not be wiser, after all, to retire to
Hong Kong. In the end, however, the official decided to stay, mainly
because he knew that the next coastguard steamer, that which was
expected in during the course of the afternoon, would inevitably have
as passengers Basil Hayle and Juan Vagas.</p>
<p>Basil went down to Ah Lung&rsquo;s store and saw his prisoners
safely ironed, then ordered from the Chinaman sufficient stores to last
his men for three days, and sufficient cigarettes for a month, and
after that sent for the old serjeant. &ldquo;Serjeant,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I am going into Manila, taking Serjeant Reyes and ten men as
guard for the prisoners. You will take command of the rest, and start
at dawn for the stockade at Silang. Ah Lung will give you supplies
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>for the journey. Also some cigarettes. Have the
&lsquo;Assembly&rsquo; sounded. I want to speak to the men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was not entirely by accident that they fell in opposite
the Bushes&rsquo; house, though for that the old serjeant was
responsible. Mrs Bush, sitting as usual on the balcony, behind the
matting blind, could hear every word of his short speech, a little
broken when he came to thank them for their loyal devotion of the night
before, but ringing out clearly when he expressed his conviction that,
during his absence, they would take every order the old serjeant gave
as coming direct from himself. Two months previously, when they were
just raw tao from Samar, they would have ended by breaking ranks and
clustering round him; now there was nothing more than a murmur, which
swept along the line, and was infinitely grateful both to him, and to
the woman who, unknown to him, was listening from the balcony
behind.</p>
<p>This time, there were no Scouts clustering in the gateway of the
barracks, making disparaging remarks on &ldquo;dam&rsquo;
Constabulario.&rdquo; They were all inside, wondering how they would
explain matters to the girls of Igut. There was to be a <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e1889" title="Source: festa">fiesta</span>, and, of
course, a cock-fight on the following day, which meant that many
questions, awkward to answer, would be asked.</p>
<p>As Basil dismissed his men, the expected <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>coastguard steamer came in sight round the
point, greatly to his relief. True, she would not go out until the
morning, but, once his prisoners were aboard, he knew they would be
safe. He waited on the quay until she had come to an anchor, then went
off to her, calmly taking the Presidente&rsquo;s own boat, and
explained matters to her skipper. Half an hour later the Presidente,
watching from his window, saw Juan Vagas and his comrades marched down
to the quay, bundled, none too gently, into a boat, and taken aboard
the coastguard. He drew his hand across his forehead, and found it damp
with a cold sweat. If one of those four, young Pablo for instance,
turned informer to save his own neck, how many other necks would be in
danger?</p>
<p>After seeing his prisoners aboard, Basil walked back slowly to the
Bushes&rsquo; house. He had to say good-bye to Mrs Bush, and, for all
he knew, it might be many months before he saw her again. At the back
of his mind there was still that haunting sense of resentment against
Fate for allowing Bush to escape. The ethical side of the question, the
morality or immorality of it, never occurred to him, as was but natural
in a district where the Law of the Bolo was the only code which had any
force. He hated the Scout officer because he knew what sort of man he
was, and he would have welcomed Bush&rsquo;s death, because he believed
it would take a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>load of misery and humiliation off Mrs
Bush&rsquo;s shoulders; but, in justice to him, it must be said that he
had never thought of gaining any personal advantage from the
disappearance of the Captain. Mrs Bush had never given him any reason
to suppose that she regarded him otherwise than as a chance
acquaintance, whom the accidents of life, as represented by the
insurrectos, had raised to the level of a friend.</p>
<p>Rather to his surprise, he met Bush himself at the doorway of the
house; and, even more to his surprise, the Scout officer treated him
with rather sheepish cordiality. &ldquo;Come in, Hayle,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Glad you called back before you went. I hear you sent your
prisoners aboard the coastguard. You&rsquo;re a wise man. The
Presidente wanted me to rescue them for him, and I told him to go
somewhere hotter&#8202;&hellip;. Have a drink? My wife will be down in
a few minutes.&rdquo; After he had mixed the cocktails and finished his
at a gulp, he seemed to get a fresh grip on his own nerves.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I was a bit short this morning,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but the thing upset me, the suddenness of it; and I
thought at first that you might have sent me warning. Now, I hear that
there was no time for anything of that sort. Eighteen hours from
Silang, most of it in the darkness! It was a thundering good
march.&rdquo; For a moment, the soldier in him&mdash;and he had been a
soldier of no mean quality&mdash;got the upper hand of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>more
recently-acquired personality. &ldquo;I wish I had had the chance, and
I wish I had been in the fight.&rdquo; For a space he stared out
through the window, then he faced round again. &ldquo;Look here, Hayle,
what are you going to tell them in Manila about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil flushed. It was an awkward question, one not to be answered
off-hand. Had he believed that Bush&rsquo;s absence was due to anything
in the nature of cowardice he would have spared him nothing; but, so
far as that point was concerned, he had gauged the man accurately.
Sober or drunk, Bush was brave enough. And the real reason was ugly,
horribly ugly; moreover, if it came out, it would give the natives just
cause for scoffing at the white man, and, what was of infinitely
greater importance in his eyes, it would deal a deadly blow to Mrs
Bush&rsquo;s pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall report what my men did,&rdquo; he said at last,
&ldquo;and say that your Scouts were fully occupied with those who
tried to rush the barracks. If they ask me concerning you, I shall
merely say I had no time to speak to you until it was over. On the
other hand, I want you to make a deal. If I do that for you, you are to
say nothing of Felizardo being here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Bush stared at him with wide-open eyes. &ldquo;Felizardo!
Felizardo here! What do you mean, man?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Felizardo was at the lower corner of the plaza this morning.
It was he who sent word to me at Silang, his men who cut up the
insurrectos as they fled. We&rsquo;ve got to thank him, and no one
else, that Igut wasn&rsquo;t burned.&rdquo; But Captain Hayle said
nothing of Mrs Bush and the promise to Juan Vagas. He himself was going
to see to the settling of that score.</p>
<p>Captain Bush mopped his forehead. &ldquo;Old Felizardo himself here,
in Igut!&rdquo; he repeated; then a thought struck him. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t he send me warning?&rdquo; he demanded, with sudden
suspicion.</p>
<p>Basil looked out of the window at the Presidente, who was just
crossing the plaza. &ldquo;If you had shown a sign of being prepared,
the insurrectos would have become suspicious, and would not have come
in. As it was, my fellows never entered into their calculations at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explanation satisfied Bush. &ldquo;It sounds all right,&rdquo;
he began, then he was cut short by the entrance of Mrs Bush.</p>
<p>For a while, they talked on indifferent subjects, then Basil rose to
leave. &ldquo;I think I shall go aboard now,&rdquo; he said&mdash;he
had arranged for his men to spend the night in the Scout barracks.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got over my long march yet, and the coastguard
is sailing at dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Captain Bush and his wife accompanied their guest to the door.
&ldquo;We shall see you again?&rdquo; Mrs Bush asked. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>Basil nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I am sure to call in here on my way back;
and very possibly I shall go through to Silang this route. It is as
short as the other way, through Catarman&rdquo;&mdash;a statement which
was not strictly true.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush smiled. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s only <i>au
revoir</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, only <i>au revoir</i>,&rdquo; he
answered&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The coastguard steamer entered Manila, flying a signal for the
police launch, which presently arrived in a great hurry. Basil went
aboard her at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you, Jimmy,&rdquo; he said to the captain,
who had been one of his fellow-non-commissioned officers in the
Garrison Artillery. When they were in the little cabin, &ldquo;Is there
any special news in Manila?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A story about a big fight at Igut,&rdquo; the other responded
promptly, &ldquo;or rather a lot of stories. The first was that old
Felizardo had burned the place, massacred every one, except the Scout
officer&rsquo;s wife, whom he had carried off. Now they say he was
beaten, after all. Do you know anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Hayle smiled. &ldquo;A little. It was my fight,&rdquo; then,
in the briefest terms, he outlined the story. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;you had better get ashore ahead of us, and telephone up
to have these fellows, Enrique Vagas and the others, watched right
away. And tell them to send down a strong guard for my prisoners. I
don&rsquo;t want to march through the streets with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>every one staring at me; besides, my little
chaps are in rags. We&rsquo;ll give you half an hour&rsquo;s
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take long for the news to travel round Manila.
Commissioner Furber heard it by telephone from the police, and was
dumbfounded. &ldquo;Do you think it can be true?&rdquo; he asked of
Senor Guiterrez, his secretary, who had gone deadly pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I go and find out more details? I might go down to the
coastguard, and tell Captain Hayle to come up at once,&rdquo; the
secretary murmured, and, barely waiting for a reply, he hurried away,
though not in the direction of the coastguard quay. He took a
carromato, which is the local libel on a cab; but, on looking back, he
saw that another carromato was following his. He told the driver to
take a sharp turn into the Walled City, and found the other vehicle
took the same turn; then, realising that the game was up, he took a
very small revolver out of his hip-pocket, and shot himself dead.</p>
<p>Down at the Custom House, Senor Enrique Vagas heard the news, and
suddenly discovered that he had left some papers aboard the Hong Kong
mail steamer, which was just leaving. He slipped out of a side
entrance, of the existence of which the detective, who had just
arrived, did not know, got aboard the mail-boat unperceived, and from
that point onwards he disappears from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>the story. Senor
Simeon Talibat, the judge, heard the news, and merely smiled, knowing
well that they dare not indict him.</p>
<p>Commissioner Furber was sitting very grim and silent when Basil
Hayle was shown in. This was, without exception, the worst blow the
Civil Government had received, and in the first outburst of bitterness
he felt he would sooner that Igut had been destroyed, so that the blame
could have fallen on Felizardo, rather than have had this exposure of
the treachery of his Little Brown Brothers. Any sort of concealment was
practically impossible now, in view of the suicide of his secretary, of
which he had just heard. The whole city had heard of it too, and had
put its own construction on it. Consequently, he did not feel kindly
towards Captain Basil Hayle, and showed so by his manner. The wonderful
forced march from Silang, over the pass to Igut, the sudden, paralysing
attack, the relentless justice meted out to the insurrectos, were, he
knew, things which would appeal to the mob; but they left him and his
colleagues cold. They were contrary to the interests of the
Party&mdash;and of themselves.</p>
<p>The interview with Basil was a brief one. Basil himself had come
intending to say nothing of Felizardo&rsquo;s intervention, feeling
certain that, by mentioning it, he would only increase the bitterness
against the old chief, and lay himself open to suspicion, which would
result in his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>removal from the district. He had ample proof
that it was the insurrectos who had made the attack&mdash;proofs, in
the form of certain papers found on the prisoners, which he did not
mention to the Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make out a formal report, and let me have it as soon as
possible,&rdquo; the Commissioner said, after Basil had given him an
outline of what had occurred.</p>
<p>Basil got up. &ldquo;And the prisoners?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be brought to trial, of course,&rdquo; the other
snapped. &ldquo;I presume you have good evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We took them red-handed,&rdquo; Basil answered grimly, and
prepared to go out.</p>
<p>The Commissioner called him back for a parting shot. &ldquo;How many
did you kill?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found eighty-one dead out of a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is abominable!&rdquo; Mr Furber&rsquo;s voice shook with
indignation. &ldquo;You should have taken them prisoners. Probably,
most of them were poor misguided peasants, who thought they were
serving their country. You must have had a carnival of bloodshed. It is
monstrous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil did not trouble whether the door banged behind him or no.</p>
<p>Half the non-official white population of Manila seemed to be out in
the street waiting for him&mdash;the captain of the coastguard steamer
had been talking freely, as had also the Constabulary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>soldiers&mdash;and Mr Commissioner Furber could
hear the cheers, even after he had closed the windows of his office.
When Clancy of the <i>Manila Star</i>, and Johnson of the
<i>Herald</i>, and Hurd of the <i>Record</i>, ran Basil to earth in his
hotel, he found that they knew as much, or more, of the story than he
did&mdash;in fact he begged them to delete certain portions relating to
himself; but one point he did ask them to emphasise&mdash;that, if
successful, the raid would have been ascribed to Felizardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did they get the guns?&rdquo; Clancy asked suddenly.
&ldquo;They say they were all new small-bores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Basil would not tell him. &ldquo;Wait for the trial,&rdquo; was
all they could get from him.</p>
<p>When the trial came, however, that point, and a great many others as
well, did not come out. Juan Vagas and his comrades were tried as
ordinary ladrones. No reference was made to any political conspiracy,
and the evidence was merely of a formal nature. It was a matter of
common knowledge that tremendous efforts had been made to save the
accused at any cost, on account of their family connections; but,
though the Commission would have given way gladly enough, it dare not
face the storm of indignation which would have been aroused amongst the
white population. So, in the end, Juan Vagas and the three ex-majors
were condemned to be hanged by the neck <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>as common highway
robbers&mdash;which they were not.</p>
<p>Still, the subterfuge did not prevent people from talking; because
there were the suicide of Mr Furber&rsquo;s secretary, and the
disappearance of Chief Collector Sharler&rsquo;s brother-in-law to be
explained; also that matter of the smuggling of the rifles, and one or
two other little things. But the Commissioners were true to the Party,
and to themselves, all through. The Chief Collector continued
collecting and preaching Racial Equality; Senor Simeon Talibat
continued judging, and often sentencing, honourable men, some of whom
were white; and the only unfortunate thing was that Vagas and his
friends had to be hanged. Moreover, it had been hinted unmistakably
that they must be hanged publicly, so that all men might be sure of
their death.</p>
<p>It was over that execution that Commissioner Furber sought to have
his revenge on Captain Basil Hayle for the trouble he had caused.
&ldquo;You brought them in. They are your prisoners. You shall have the
hanging of them,&rdquo; he snarled, looking to see the Virginian flush
with rage. But therein he was disappointed, not knowing of the score
against Juan Vagas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall I have them hanged?&rdquo; Basil asked calmly.
&ldquo;On the Luneta, in front of the band-stand? All Manila could see
there.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span></p>
<p>Again Mr Furber snarled. &ldquo;Of course not. Take them out to
Calocan; and do it very early one morning. I&rsquo;ll leave it all to
you, as you seem ready enough to do the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil Hayle looked him squarely in the face, which was a thing the
Commissioner himself never did to a man. &ldquo;I would hang them, and
a dozen more, some insurrectos, some white men who are traitors to
their race, if I could,&rdquo; he said very quietly. Then he went to
Calocan, and arranged for the building of a new gallows on the site of
the old one, opposite what had once been Don Jos&eacute;
Ramirez&rsquo;s store, and was now the store of Lippmann and Klosky,
American citizens.</p>
<p>No man except Basil Hayle and the prison officials knew where the
prisoners were spending the night before the execution. As a matter of
fact, however, they were on board a large launch, which was moored a
mile from the shore, and the party of patriots, who were in ambush on
the road, with the idea of rescuing their brethren, merely got wet and
cramped as a reward for their devotion. Still, there was a crowd of two
or three hundred on the plaza, of whom at least half were wearing
bolos.</p>
<p>Basil&rsquo;s total force consisted of his own ten men, with twenty
more Manila Constabulary under a lieutenant, and even this
reinforcement had been granted to him grudgingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are the local police,&rdquo; the Commissioner
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>had said, to which Basil had replied in
practical fashion by taking all the rifles away from those police on
the night previous to the execution. Still, despite this precaution,
matters looked dangerous when they marched the prisoners ashore. They
had roped in a space over night, and in that space Basil posted the
Constabulary, in front of the new gallows, facing the crowd, and told
them to load with ball, so that all men might be warned; but he noticed
one, at least, of the Manila men slip in a blank cartridge, which made
him feel more uneasy than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for it, properly,&rdquo; he whispered to the
lieutenant; then he went to the two ex-soldiers who had volunteered to
act as hangman, the insurrectos having roasted some of their chums to
death during the war. &ldquo;Be as quick as you can,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And if we haven&rsquo;t time to hang them, shoot them.
I&rsquo;ll take all responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had hardly spoken the words before he caught the flash of a bolo
being drawn in the crowd. Vagas was then at the foot of the gallows,
and Basil was by his side in a moment, pressing the muzzle of his
revolver against his head. &ldquo;Go up the ladder,&rdquo; he said;
then he saw another bolo being drawn, and another, and yet another. The
crowd was swaying now. &ldquo;Steady! steady!&rdquo; he called to his
men. &ldquo;If they break the ropes or cut them, fire at once.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>Those in front, against the ropes, heard his words, and seeing the
revolver at Juan Vagas&rsquo;s head, tried to draw back, knowing that
they would have been the sufferers from the one volley which the
Constabulary could have hoped to get off. But those behind, the mass of
the crowd, having no such fears, struggled and fought to get forward,
or to force the others forward. There were a hundred drawn bolos now. A
few seconds more, and the ropes would have been down, when a boudjon
brayed out with startling suddenness from the line of bush which formed
the top end of the little plaza, and, as men looked round in
astonishment, they saw what seemed to be innumerable white-clad
bolomen, jumping up out of the long grass into which they had crawled
from the jungle, whilst, in the background, was a little old man on a
grey horse.</p>
<p>Twice more the boudjon sounded, and then the word passed from man to
man in the crowd. &ldquo;Felizardo! Felizardo himself! He has sworn
they shall be hanged, because of what they had planned to do.&rdquo;
Before the third blast had died away, every bolo had been sheathed, and
every man was standing still, shivering a little.</p>
<p>Basil Hayle thrust his revolver into his holster again, and came
back to his place in front of his men, where he stood very still whilst
they did justice on Juan Vagas and his fellows. Then, when it was over,
for the second time in his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href=
"#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>life, he raised his hand in salute
to the little old man on the grey horse, and also for the second time
Felizardo lifted his hat. A moment later the bush had swallowed up him
and his men.</p>
<p>There were three reporters at the execution, and the copy they
handed in rejoiced exceedingly the hearts of their respective editors.
But Mr Commissioner Furber and Mr Commissioner Gumpertz and one or two
other Commissioners used violent language. &ldquo;The scoundrel&rsquo;s
impertinence must be stopped at once,&rdquo; they said; whilst, in the
Walled City, the ex-generals and colonels and majors of the patriot
forces gnashed their teeth with fury, and began to evolve new schemes
against Felizardo. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">HOW MR COMMISSIONER FURBER MET FELIZARDO</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The night after the hanging of Juan Vagas, the
insurrecto, who had tried to raid Igut and carry off Mrs Bush, Basil
Hayle dined at the Military Club, where they made much of him,
although, as a rule, the Army regarded the Constabulary much as it
regarded the Civil Service, as being beneath its notice, which was
quite unjust&mdash;so far as the Constabulary was concerned.</p>
<p>It was well after midnight when Basil left the Club in the company
of old Major John Flint of the Infantry. They were both staying at the
same hotel, and their way back led through the narrow streets of the
Walled City, and thence across the Bridge of Spain, into the newer part
of Manila. They passed one or two native police slouching along,
looking what they really were, more like thieves than thief-takers.
With the exception of these, however, the streets seemed to be
absolutely deserted; consequently, when, from out of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>dark
gateway, a couple of natives, or rather mestizos, armed with knives,
sprang at Basil and his companion, the white men were taken absolutely
unawares.</p>
<p>Basil dodged to one side as his assailant struck, and the knife
merely caught him a glancing blow on the ribs, doing little damage;
then he himself got a grip on the mestizo&rsquo;s throat, lifted him
bodily off the ground with the other hand, and flung him at the man who
was attacking Major Flint. The second mestizo staggered, dropped his
knife, then took to his heels and fled down the street, right into the
arms of a gigantic Sikh watchman from a neighbouring Government
building&mdash;you can make your Little Brown Brother into a judge of
the High Court, but you cannot trust him to guard Government
stores&mdash;who, hearing shouts, had hurried up. The Sikh did not
waste either time or words. He took that mestizo by the collar of his
coat with one hand, and by his belt with the other hand, and forthwith
dashed his brains out on the pavement, then tossed the body into the
middle of the street, and began to wonder how he should purify himself
after having touched such an unclean thing.</p>
<p>Basil was binding his handkerchief round an ugly flesh wound in the
major&rsquo;s forearm, and keeping his foot on the neck of the other
mestizo, when the Sikh came up and saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have killed the one, Sahib,&rdquo; the watchman
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>said. &ldquo;Shall I&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; he
nodded expressively towards the other would-be murderer, who, hearing
the words, squirmed.</p>
<p>Basil smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;I think not, serjeant. But I
wish you would look after him whilst we go along the street and see if
we can find some of the police. How about the other one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sikh saluted again. &ldquo;I caught him trying to break into the
Government store-house. He attacked me with a knife, and in the
struggle I happened to kill him. So I shall report to-morrow, Sahib. It
will save trouble,&rdquo; he added simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious dearth of police,&rdquo; Basil remarked to the major
as they walked up the street after leaving the Sikh in charge.
&ldquo;It rather looks as if they didn&rsquo;t want to be about. I
shouldn&rsquo;t have had much of a show if I had been alone, as I
suppose they expected me to be. Hullo! what&rsquo;s that building
lighted up? The <i>Manila Star</i>, isn&rsquo;t it? We might go in and
see Clancy, and get him to telephone for a carromato for you. That hand
of yours ought to be seen to at once; and I expect he&rsquo;s got a
drink there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy was just preparing to leave. He had just sent his paper to
press&mdash;he was his own chief sub-editor&mdash;but he went back to
his room when he saw his visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this?
You&rsquo;ve <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>got it in the hand, major; and you seem to have
got it in the ribs, Hayle,&rdquo; pointing to a wet, dull red patch on
Basil&rsquo;s tunic.</p>
<p>Basil looked down in surprise. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know the
little beast had got through my clothes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It can
only be a scratch. I wish you would telephone to the livery stable for
a carromato, and then to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst they were waiting, Basil gave the editor an outline of what
had occurred. Clancy groaned. &ldquo;My luck. If it had been half an
hour earlier, it would have been a fine scoop for the paper.
&lsquo;Vengeance for Vagas&rsquo;&mdash;there&rsquo;s a snorting good
headline for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw the major off to the hospital in the carromato, and then
Clancy walked down the street with Basil to the scene of the attack.
The Sikh was still on guard, having secured the prisoner with his
belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at this chap,&rdquo; Clancy said, but
when he had scrutinised the mestizo&rsquo;s features, he shook his
head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know him at all;&rdquo; then they went over
to where the other lay, in the middle of the road, and Clancy gave a
low whistle. &ldquo;This one I do know, though. He is, or rather he
was, in the Education Department, one of Dr Charburn&rsquo;s especial
pets&mdash;in fact, I heard they were going to make him headmaster of
some Government school. There&rsquo;ll be a vacancy now, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later the police came along, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>three natives, and took over the prisoner with
an air of surly indifference to the whole matter. Even the sight of the
Constabulary officer&rsquo;s uniform was insufficient to make them
outwardly civil and respectful. As they were moving off, Basil caught
the word &ldquo;hangman,&rdquo; and flushed crimson. Then he called
them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I come round to-morrow morning I shall report you for
not saluting. Do you hear? I will take no insolence from you. Now get
along quick, or there&rsquo;ll be more trouble for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clancy smiled. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry to go to the station
in the morning. That prisoner will escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He proved to be a true prophet. When Basil was shown into the police
captain&rsquo;s room, the latter gave him a queer look. &ldquo;Want me
on business, Captain Hayle?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Or is this just a
friendly social call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil understood. &ldquo;Has he got away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police captain nodded and pushed the box of cigars across to his
guest. &ldquo;It never happened. Major Flint had an accident to his
hand, and you&mdash;well, your ribs don&rsquo;t show. The night captain
called up Some One; and he said that, with the Vagas and Guiterrez
business, they had had about enough to be going on with for some time;
so your friend was let loose, and has probably bought a new knife by
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo; Basil asked.</p>
<p>The captain mentioned the name of a well-known <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>mestizo planter. &ldquo;His youngest son, just
back from London, where they seem to allow any fool-doctrine to be
taught to coloured men. Pity the Sikh didn&rsquo;t finish him too
whilst he was about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure myself next time,&rdquo; Basil said
grimly; &ldquo;one gets tired of this sort of business. What did they
do with the other fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That carrion?&rdquo; The police captain was a man of plain
speech. &ldquo;The night captain proposed to tie a stone to it and drop
it over the Bridge of Spain, into the Pasig; but he got orders to
discover an accidental death, a fall from an upper window&mdash;you
understand?&mdash;and they&rsquo;re going to have a big funeral to-day,
all the Education Department, wreaths, speeches, flourishing career cut
short, and so on. Makes you smile, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil Hayle thought of the knife which had glanced along his ribs,
and the big gash in the old major&rsquo;s hand, and the Sikh wondering
how he could purify himself after having touched such vermin, but most
of all he thought of the shame and the danger to his country, and
therefore he did not smile.</p>
<p>As he got up to leave, a sudden thought struck him. &ldquo;Clancy
knows,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Clancy was on the spot a few minutes
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police captain nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just seen him, and, as
a favour to the force, he is going <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186"
href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>to forget it. But he
wouldn&rsquo;t have done so for Furber; no, sir. Awkward sort of an
Irishman, unless you handle him right. They&rsquo;d have deported him
long ago, if he had been an American citizen. Well, so-long, Captain.
I&rsquo;d be careful, if I were you, at nights. You might have a worse
accident next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving for Igut by the coastguard steamer this
afternoon,&rdquo; Basil answered.</p>
<p>Commissioner Furber made no reference to the incident of the
previous night when Basil called on him to see if there were any
further orders, nor did the Captain himself allude to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go back to your post at Silang,&rdquo; the
Commissioner said, &ldquo;and police that district, endeavouring to
obtain as much information as possible concerning Felizardo. One thing
more&mdash;remember you are posted on the northern side of the
mountains, and there you are to remain. We want no more of these
theatrical marches, ending in massacres of deluded peasants. I have had
reports from the Presidente and other local officials, as well as from
some friends in Manila, which go to prove that Igut was never in any
real danger. I might add that the Governor-General is extremely annoyed
at your conduct. You know his constant endeavour has been to gain the
confidence and good-will of our Little Brown Brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was one of Mr Commissioner Furber&rsquo;s customs never to look a
man in the face; consequently, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"
href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>he missed Basil&rsquo;s
expression, though, perhaps, the way in which Basil strode out of the
room may have told him something.</p>
<p>Mr Furber sighed. &ldquo;A most dangerous, insolent
Southerner,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;And yet, whilst he is a hero in
Manila it would be unsafe to dismiss him. I could almost wish that
those men last night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off suddenly,
conscious that he was lapsing from those strict Methodist principles in
which he had been brought up.</p>
<p>Mr Commissioner Gumpertz, on the other hand, had fewer religious
scruples, having been in politics much longer than his colleague.
&ldquo;I wish to blazes they had knifed the swine,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s put a stop to the sale of that hemp land. I
can&rsquo;t get any one to go out and have a look at it now. They just
shake their heads, and say,
&lsquo;Head-hunters.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr William P. Hart, to whom he spoke, expectorated carefully at a
lizard on the window-sill. &ldquo;Furber will give him plenty of
chances of getting his throat cut. Furber&rsquo;s a bit pious, but he
don&rsquo;t forget all the same, nor does Sharler. This Vagas business
has hit &rsquo;em hard; and Mrs Sharler, Vagas&rsquo;s sister you know,
has a tongue. It&rsquo;s not nice for a Chief Collector of Customs to
have his brother-in-law hanged publicly. Did you hear they burned the
new gallows at Calocan last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil heard the same news as he was going <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>aboard the coastguard steamer, and laughed
grimly. &ldquo;A bit futile, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he remarked to his
informant. &ldquo;They had served their purpose already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil only stayed a few hours at Igut, just long enough to see Mrs
Bush, and tell her what had occurred in Manila. She shuddered a little
when she heard how he had been ordered to superintend the executions.
&ldquo;How horrible!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and what an abominable
insult to you. I wonder you did not refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;It was meant as an insult, I know; but I
was glad to do the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; She looked at him in amazement, and he thought a
little coldly. &ldquo;Why, Captain Hayle? You say you were glad to be a
kind of hangman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not mean Juan Vagas to escape,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I had sworn he should die, if I had to go into the prison and
shoot him myself.&rdquo; And there was a look on his face which showed
her he meant what he was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t quite understand why you should have been
so bitter against him personally. What was the reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil was staring out of the window. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain
now; perhaps I will, some day, later on.&rdquo; And with that she had
to be content for the moment, though, by dint of questioning her maid,
who in turn questioned others in the town, she got some clue to the
truth a few <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>days later, and found much food for thought
therein. She began to understand what had kept Basil going through that
terrible march from Silang.</p>
<p>Captain Bush came in just before Basil left. The Scout officer was
grateful for what the other had not said in his report, and expressed
his thanks with what was for him almost heartiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to stay to-night?&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We can put
you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry it can&rsquo;t be managed,&rdquo; Basil answered.
&ldquo;I brought my ten men back with me, and I want to get across to
Silang as soon as I can. No, I must go.&rdquo; He stared out of the
window again.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush, watching him, understood what an effort it was costing him
to say those words, and honoured him in her heart accordingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to have a try at Felizardo. They are sending
Vigne&rsquo;s company of Scouts round to co-operate with mine.&rdquo;
Bush&rsquo;s voice recalled Basil suddenly. &ldquo;We are going to try
and show you Constabulary how to do things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil gripped the arm of his chair at the thought which immediately
flashed through his mind. &ldquo;Bush is going up to Felizardo&rsquo;s
mountains. Would Bush ever come back?&rdquo; He, Basil Hayle, knew only
too well what the dangers of the expedition would be.</p>
<p>For an instant Basil thought of saying nothing, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>of
letting the other go to his fate; then he remembered that, though Bush
might be a man he loathed, Bush was also, and above all things, an
officer in the service of the United States, so he spoke very gravely.
&ldquo;I have been up there, Bush, and I know what it means. Two
companies of Scouts are utterly useless for the job. You will be able
to do practically nothing, and you&rsquo;ll be lucky if you don&rsquo;t
get cut to pieces as soon as you are well into the jungle. It is sheer
lunacy sending you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bush flushed crimson. &ldquo;When I want your
advice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began, then checked himself.
&ldquo;Thanks for the information,&rdquo; he went on more quietly;
&ldquo;but Scouts are not Constabulary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unconsciously, perhaps, Basil glanced towards Mrs Bush. She was
leaning forward, with her chin resting on her hand, and he thought he
read an appeal in the look she gave him. He got up at once.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Scouts are not Constabulary, so you
may have different luck from what I had. I hope so.&rdquo; Bush,
ashamed of his outburst, muttered some thanks, but Mrs Bush, pondering
over it afterwards, was not quite sure whether he had understood the
other man&rsquo;s meaning aright, for had not Basil been up the
mountains, and come back, unharmed?&hellip;</p>
<p>Basil Hayle found the stockade at Silang in perfect order. The five
sick men he had left in it when he made the forced march to Igut were
all well again, and back at duty. No <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>one had interfered
with them during the days when they had formed the sole garrison;
rather otherwise, in fact, for a party of Felizardo&rsquo;s men had
actually come down and made a camp a few hundred yards away, thus
preventing any possibility of attack from a wandering band of ladrones,
or from those abominable head-hunters. For the first few hours, the
five had been distinctly alarmed, then some of the outlaws had come
forward and explained matters. After that, everything had gone very
smoothly. Felizardo&rsquo;s men had plenty of fresh meat, the
Constabulary had some especially choice cigarettes; consequently, it
was no difficult matter to do a deal. On the second morning, three of
the soldiers were actually guests in the outlaws&rsquo; camp, but a
return invitation was declined. The chief had given definite orders on
that point. Then, suddenly, there had come the news of the killing at
Igut&mdash;wonderful, splendid news, which had made the five rejoice
greatly one moment, and the next moment gnash their teeth with envy of
their comrades who had been in the fight. The fact that they,
themselves, must inevitably have fallen out long before the column had
reached the head of the pass was entirely forgotten. Half an hour
before the serjeant and the other men had returned, a boudjon had
sounded a mile or so away, and when, a few minutes later, one of the
five had glanced towards the outlaws&rsquo; camp, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>not
a trace of Felizardo&rsquo;s men was to be seen. Their special mission
was concluded.</p>
<p>From that time onwards, matters had gone very smoothly. Possibly,
the serjeant&rsquo;s rule had been a little lax, but, none the less, it
had been effective, and, even if the tao of Silang had seen a good deal
of the Constabularios, more perhaps than they wanted, guards had been
mounted regularly, and every man had slept within the stockade.</p>
<p>The little men were unaffectedly glad to see their officer back, and
Basil, on his part, was by no means sorry to settle down again. So much
had happened since he had left Silang that the prospect of a rest was
not unwelcome, even though it entailed being practically cut off from
the outer world, which, to his mind, now meant from Mrs Bush.
Unfortunately, however, his contentment did not last very long. Before
he had been at Silang a week, he had begun to hunger for news from the
other side of the mountain range, especially for news of the Scout
expedition against Felizardo, which was due to start about that time.
Yet, though he sent messenger after messenger to his brother officer,
Lieutenant Stott, at Catarman, he learned nothing definite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vigne&rsquo;s Scouts haven&rsquo;t turned up yet at
Igut,&rdquo; was all that Stott could report, whereat Basil had raged,
knowing that every day of delay must make disaster more certain. Then
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>suddenly a messenger had come in from Catarman,
bringing news, not only of the starting of the expedition, but also of
its return&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush had watched the Scouts march out dry-eyed. The parting
between her husband and herself had been unmarked even by the formality
of a hand-shake, for she had heard already of another parting which had
taken place in the lower end of the town an hour previously, and he had
divined that she knew. Still, there had been something almost wistful
in the man&rsquo;s eyes, some hint of the lover which had been, and a
word, the right word, would have changed everything. She had thought,
too, that she was giving him a chance to say it when she pleaded:
&ldquo;Do be careful, John, won&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t do anything
rash. Remember how they cut Captain Hayle&rsquo;s force to
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mistake had lain in mentioning Basil, as she realised
immediately. Bush&rsquo;s face had grown dark at once, and he had
muttered a curse on the Constabulary in general, and Basil Hayle in
particular; then with a curt &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; he had stalked out
into the plaza, where Lieutenant Vigne was awaiting him. Mrs Bush had
kept her tears back until they were out of sight, then she had hurried
to her room, wondering why people were allowed to be so wretched.</p>
<p>It was a cargadore, one of Bush&rsquo;s carriers, who brought in the
first news. He arrived about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>noon on the following day,
breathless, in rags, with a slight bolo-cut in his shoulder. He was the
sole survivor, he declared to old Don Juan Ramirez, who cross-examined
him. Was he quite sure of that? They gave him a much-needed glass of
spirits and a cigarette, and then asked him again. Was he still sure
there were none others? No, now he came to think of it there were some
left, a little group, which, with Bush as its rear guard, was
retreating down the hillside, fighting all the way, when he himself
managed to dive into the jungle. There were many wounded too, very
many, and the other officer was dead. He, Pedro, had actually seen his
head cut off with a bolo. On that point he was certain.</p>
<p>Don Juan had heard enough. He sighed, put on the black silk jacket
he kept for ceremonial occasions, and went to pay one of his rare
visits to Mrs Bush, whom he admired as much as he loathed her husband.
She came down to meet him, white-faced and trembling, having seen the
cargadore arrive. &ldquo;They are coming back,&rdquo; Don Juan
said.</p>
<p>She drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Ah! And Captain Bush?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Jos&eacute; prided himself on his knowledge of womankind, but he
could not decide what her tone meant. &ldquo;Captain Bush is bringing
them back. I hear, though, that there are many wounded. I have told
them to clear out my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195"
name="pb195">195</a>]</span>big warehouse to serve as a hospital.
Perhaps you would honour me by coming to see to the
arrangements?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clutched eagerly at the chance of having something to do, and
when, just before sundown, the remnant of the column crawled in, with
half a dozen badly wounded on rough stretchers, and only fifteen
unwounded out of the forty-eight survivors, it found everything ready.
The surgeon, who had come up with Lieutenant Vigne, and had himself
escaped untouched, forgot half his weariness when he glanced round.
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was afraid there might be
nothing, not even hot water. Do you think you could help me, Mrs Bush?
Can you stand the sight of it? Very well.&rdquo; Then he stripped off
his coat, rolled up his sleeves, and barely said a word till midnight,
when he straightened himself up, and after that staggered a little.
&ldquo;That is all, Mrs Bush. Now, could you give me a
drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She brought him the bottle and a glass. He poured out nearly half a
tumblerful of brandy, and drank it off like water. &ldquo;You can do
that when you&rsquo;ve been through Hell, Mrs Bush,&rdquo; he said,
noticing her look. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll have a sleep now,&rdquo;
and he rolled his jacket up for a pillow, and put it in one of the
corners.</p>
<p>She laid her hand on his sleeve. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t do that,
doctor. You must come to the house. I have a room ready for you.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span></p>
<p>He bent down and kissed her hand, being overwrought. &ldquo;One of
those men will certainly die before dawn, two others are just on the
border line. If I am here, I may save them. The orderlies will call me
when the crises come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bush went out, returning a couple of minutes later. The doctor
was already asleep, so she took a blanket from a pile behind the door,
and covered him over very gently; then she went back to the house to
look for her husband, whom, so far, she had only seen for a
moment&mdash;just long enough to make sure that he was unwounded. But
Captain Bush was not to be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went out with the Treasurer and the Supervisor,
Senora,&rdquo; a very sleepy muchacho informed her.</p>
<p>Like the doctor, Mrs Bush was deadly tired, and yet it was almost
dawn before she went to sleep; this was the final, the most abominable
insult of all. Next morning she took a definite step, writing a long
letter to Captain Basil Hayle, giving him an account of the expedition
as she had heard it from the doctor, in itself a perfectly harmless
letter, and yet one the sending of which amounted to a repudiation of
her husband&rsquo;s right to control her. He had his friends; she would
have hers.</p>
<p>The story of the fight had been the story of Basil&rsquo;s defeat of
two or three months previously over again; only, this time, no boudjons
had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>given warning; and the attack had begun with a
volley poured in at twenty yards range by riflemen hidden amongst the
undergrowth. The Scouts, winded by the long climb up the muddy
hillside, had been able to put up no effective resistance against the
bolomen, who came in under cover of the smoke. Those who did escape,
leaving some seventy of their comrades, including Lieutenant Vigne,
dead in the jungle, owed their safety to the fact that they had been
able to keep together in a bunch; but, even then, it had been a running
fight all the way back to the level ground, a fight in which Bush had
showed a savage, dogged courage, being himself the last man the whole
time.</p>
<p>The Philippine Scouts though often, as in this case, loaned to the
Civil Government, form part of the United States Army; consequently, it
was impossible for the Commission to do as it had done in the case of
Basil Hayle&rsquo;s disaster, suppress news of the whole affair. The
Army had the best of reasons for despising and detesting the
politicians at the Palace, so it was not long before all Manila was in
possession of the facts.</p>
<p>Mr Commissioner Furber waxed exceeding wroth, and proceeded to make
matters much worse for his colleagues and himself by attempting to
blame the Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felizardo has only some fifty followers in all,&rdquo; he
declared to a representative of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>leading mestizo
paper, which reproduced his remarks. &ldquo;We have that on the best
authority. It seems amazing that the Scouts should have retreated
before such a small body, leaving so many dead behind them. The
Governor-General is most perturbed about the affair, fearing that
people at home may imagine that the culprits are some of our Little
Brown Brothers, instead of being a gang of thieves and
murderers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the following months, expedition after expedition was
dispatched against Felizardo, each larger and more costly than the
last; yet each came back with a story of hardship and disaster. If
Felizardo did allow it to get above the jungle on to the open
mountain-side, it was sniped at, every foot of the way, by unseen
riflemen, until its nerve was gone, and it decided to return to the
cover of the bush, where the bolomen speedily got to work on it. No
trace of a permanent camp was ever found, the enemy was never seen,
save when he himself had chosen the time and place. It was inglorious,
nerve-shattering, futile; and when the last expedition, which had
consisted of some four hundred Scouts and Constabulary, returned with
twenty men short and nearly fifty wounded, there was a very general
feeling that Felizardo should be left alone for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; as the General in command of Manila said to
the Governor, &ldquo;what harm <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199"
href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>does the old man do to us? I
understand that, from the first, he has only asked to be left alone. I
know he hanged some of your Brown Brothers&mdash;a good thing too. I
wish he had hanged every insurrecto. They all deserved it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon, the Governor, who had never been in the war, and knew his
Brown Brother only as a useful pawn in a certain political game in the
United States, grew angry, and as soon as the plain-spoken General had
gone, sent for Mr Commissioner Furber and one or two distinguished
officials who had held great positions under the insurrecto Government,
and with these he took counsel, and, after much discussion and
deliberation, there was evolved a great scheme, which seemed certain to
succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go out myself,&rdquo; Mr Furber said, &ldquo;then I
shall know that no chance of escape is being allowed to the old
villain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scheme, like that of the late Juan Vagas, took a little time to
prepare. &ldquo;We must get some source of information from
within,&rdquo; the Commissioner declared, and, with that end in view,
he gave two of his mestizo assistants a free hand to buy the help of
one, or, if possible, more of Felizardo&rsquo;s men. The first pair of
mestizos drew five thousand pesos for a start, then, probably in a fit
of mental aberration, wandered aboard the Hong Kong <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>steamer, and were seen no more in the Philippine
Islands. The second pair were more successful; in fact, possibly
because they were escorted as far as Igut, the men did their work
extremely well. Mr Furber never enquired into the means employed, and
no explanation was volunteered. Still, as the reports which came in
showed, two of the band had unquestionably turned traitors. The
Commissioner was well pleased; it was a good start.</p>
<p>Then, from all parts of the Islands, native troops, Scouts and
Constabulary, every man who could be spared from his district, began to
come in to Manila, until there were fully three thousand of them ready,
if not exactly eager, to start on the great rounding up of the outlaws.
Only Basil Hayle and his company seemed to have been left out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always trouble where that man goes,&rdquo; the
Commissioner said to the Governor-General. &ldquo;We had better let him
stay at Silang. He must be pretty weary of the place by now, and he may
resign. I hope so,&rdquo; a view with which the other, who had no
fondness for soldiers and men of action, agreed.</p>
<p>They made a base camp at Igut, greatly to the astonishment and
profit of the people of the place. Mr Commissioner Furber stayed with
the Presidente, and was not introduced to Mrs Bush, although he had
expressed a desire to meet her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"
href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; Mrs Bush said to a mutual acquaintance who
mentioned the matter to her, &ldquo;tell him that if he chooses to stay
in a native&rsquo;s house, he can remain with the natives. I have a
prejudice in favour of my own colour,&rdquo; words which, when repeated
to Mr Furber, tended to confirm his prejudice against women from the
South. He, in turn, repeated the words to the Presidente, who thereupon
made a remark about Mrs Bush and Captain Hayle which would have caused
most white men to throw him out of the window, and would inevitably
have made Basil Hayle kill him. But Mr Commissioner Furber, being of
the Brown Brother school, listened to it all, and congratulated himself
on having got a new weapon against the Constabulary officer.</p>
<p>They distributed a thousand men along the northern side of the
range, and a thousand along the southern side, whilst a thousand more
went up on to the pass which you crossed going to Silang, and started
to sweep the upper heights, whilst the others closed in gradually. They
were going to drive the outlaws into that same patch of jungle where
Basil had met with defeat, at the seaward end of the range, near
Katubig.</p>
<p>Mr Furber himself took up his quarters near the site of the latter
place, whither the Presidente of Igut accompanied him, rather
reluctantly, feeling, perhaps, that he was going rather too
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>near to Felizardo&rsquo;s country, though he did
not like to say so much to the Commissioner.</p>
<p>It is one thing to order troops to sweep the heights of a mountain
range, and then yourself to go down to the coast and wait for results;
it is quite another matter for the troops themselves, especially when
none of the men happen to be mountaineers by birth. Still, the little
fellows did their best, despite the constant loss from snipers, who
never save a chance of a shot in reply; and the officers were satisfied
that none of the outlaws had slipped through the line.</p>
<p>The men on the northern slope met with no resistance, although, when
the roll was called, it was obvious that, somehow or other, the
head-hunters had secured twenty-four fresh trophies from stragglers;
whilst the party on the south side never even fired a shot.</p>
<p>On the fourth morning, they reported to Mr Furber that they must
have driven the outlaws down on to the seaward slope, and that it was
now only a case of closing in and capturing, or slaying, the whole
band. The message had hardly been delivered when another came in, this
time from one of those two traitors in Felizardo&rsquo;s own camp. The
band had broken up suddenly the previous night. The outlaws, feeling
the game was hopeless, had gone, each his own way, slipping through the
cordon of troops in the darkness, singly, and leaving old <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>Felizardo alone with the two traitors. The three
were now hiding in a small patch of jungle, almost on the same spot
where Basil had his fight, and, if the troops closed in quickly, they
would be certain to get the old chief.</p>
<p>Mr Furber&rsquo;s heart rejoiced, whilst a load of anxiety seemed to
slip from the shoulders of the Presidente.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them close in at once,&rdquo; Mr Furber said. &ldquo;They
must lose no time, and when they have him, let them bring him down
here, to Katubig. I have had a set of irons brought. As for the
two&mdash;the two men who have been aiding us&rdquo;&mdash;traitor is
an ugly word&mdash;&ldquo;see that they are not injured in the
excitement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The troops moved quickly. They were utterly weary of their task,
believing in their own minds that it must prove futile, but the
unexpected news passed out by the traitors put fresh heart into them.
They were going to capture the great Felizardo, after all; and each man
would be able to declare to the girls in his village that it was he who
had done the deed. They surrounded that stretch of jungle on every
side, and they drew in the cordon until the men were almost touching
one another, hand to hand; and yet there was never a sign of life from
inside the ring.</p>
<p>A queer nervousness ran through them all, white officers and natives
alike. Was he still there, the terrible little old man? Was he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>really going to be captured at last, after
nearly thirty-six years? What was he doing now? What would he do?
What&mdash;&mdash; And then Felizardo himself answered all the
questions.</p>
<p>A grey horse seemed to spring from nowhere, and the look on the face
of his rider was like nothing else any of them had ever seen. It was
before that look that they cowered, rather than before the revolver in
the outstretched hand. The horse went through the line as if no one
were there, though one of its hoofs cracked the skull of a serjeant of
Constabulary, who was standing, open-mouthed, in its course.</p>
<p>From first to last, it was a matter of seconds, twenty yards of open
jungle at the outside, and both the grey and its rider were out of
sight before the belated volley rattled harmlessly after them. They
passed the word round the cordon, and the white officers sat down and
mopped their foreheads, and wondered what Commissioner Furber would
say. Then a thought struck one of them. &ldquo;Where are those two
spies of Furber&rsquo;s? I wonder whether&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He did
not finish the sentence, but took half a company and went to
investigate for himself. After a while, he found them both, hanging
from the branch of a tree, with the torn fragments of the banknotes
which had been the price of their treason scattered over the ground
beneath them.</p>
<p>The officer exchanged glances with his serjeant. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>&ldquo;He has done it, single-handed,&rdquo; he
said in an awestruck voice.</p>
<p>The serjeant drew a deep breath. &ldquo;It is ill work to betray
Felizardo, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Commissioner Furber and the Presidente of Igut were sitting in
the cool, nipa-thatched shack which served them as headquarters,
waiting for news of the capture of Felizardo, when one of the
half-dozen members of the Igut police, who were serving as escort,
suddenly tumbled up the little ladder into the shack, and tried to hide
himself in a corner. &ldquo;There are bolomen,&rdquo; he gasped.
&ldquo;They have taken the others prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Presidente of Igut sat rigid, apparently glued to his chair,
staring through the doorway at a little man on a grey horse, who had
just ridden into the clearing, followed by a score of bolomen; but
Commissioner Furber stood up to face the danger, like a white man
should. It was, in a sense, the supreme moment of his life, and the
good blood which was in him proved stronger than the effects of the
evil training he had been given.</p>
<p>He had left his revolver hanging on one of the posts of the little
veranda, which was fortunate for him; otherwise, he would have started
to shoot, and they would have had to kill him.</p>
<p>Felizardo brought his horse right up to the foot of the little
ladder, and then he spoke. &ldquo;You are the Senor Furber? Good! I am
Felizardo. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>I was told you wished to see me, so I have come.
What is it you would say, Senor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time for many years, Commissioner Furber was at a loss
for words. &ldquo;I &hellip; you&rdquo;&mdash;he stammered a
little&mdash;&ldquo;you are at war with the Government, and it is my
duty to have you captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled. &ldquo;But no, Senor. The Americanos make war on
me, which is very different. I am the Chief of these mountains. All I
wish is to be left alone, as I have said many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly to his own surprise, Mr Furber felt a keen desire to argue
the point with this outlaw and Enemy of the Sovereign People. &ldquo;It
is impossible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The whole island must be under
our law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one law here,&rdquo; the other retorted,
&ldquo;the Law of the Bolo. Will you carry that word back to
Manila?&rdquo; Furber flushed slightly; so his life was to be spared.
&ldquo;You are in my power. Your troops cannot be here for at least an
hour, time enough in which to kill many men; but I will let you go,
because, after all, I want peace. Will you take my message to your
people?&rdquo; And Mr Furber promised.</p>
<p>Felizardo beckoned to a couple of his men, then turned to the
Commissioner again. &ldquo;There is justice to be done, though, on the
Presidente of Igut. He was in league with the band of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>Juan
Vagas. Read that, Senor,&rdquo; and he handed a letter to the white
man, who, after having read it, looked very sternly at the trembling
magistrate of Igut. Somehow, Mr Furber&rsquo;s views had changed
greatly during the last few minutes. He turned to Felizardo again.
&ldquo;I will deal with him, Senor, on my honour,&rdquo; he said, and
for a moment there was a spark of hope in the Presidente&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>But Felizardo said: &ldquo;He is my prisoner, Senor Furber. Besides,
it will save time and trouble.&rdquo; Then he nodded to his two men,
who dragged the Presidente out of the shack. The shivering wretch
caught hold of Furber&rsquo;s leg as he was hauled past, but the
Commissioner shook himself free, and went inside, so that he should not
see what they were going to do.</p>
<p>It was, as Felizardo had predicted, an hour later when the first of
the troops came back. Whilst the men were cutting down the body of the
Presidente, the officer in command hurried to the shack, where he found
the Commissioner sitting at the table with his head buried in his
hands. He looked wearily up as the other came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have lost him, after all, sir,&rdquo; the officer
reported.</p>
<p>He had expected an outburst of wrath, but instead of that the
Commissioner said, very quietly: &ldquo;I know. Felizardo himself has
been here to tell me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=

<h2 class="main">HOW MR COMMISSIONER GUMPERTZ OFFERED A REWARD</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In his stockade at Silang, Basil Hayle waited
anxiously for news of the result of the great expedition against
Felizardo. As an officer of the Philippines Constabulary, he felt he
ought to hope that the band of outlaws would be broken up, and their
chief either captured or killed. As a man, he could not disguise from
himself the fact that he would be extremely sorry were any ill-luck to
befall the old chief, who had proved his friend on so many occasions.
The idea of Felizardo being taken and hanged, as Juan Vagas had
deservedly been hanged, was absolutely repulsive to him; though on that
point he had not much fear, feeling certain that they would never take
the outlaw alive.</p>
<p>Basil knew perfectly well that he had been excluded from all
participation in the movement purposely, with a view to hurting his
pride, by forcing him to remain in a state of inglorious inaction, a
few miles from the scene <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>of hostilities, whilst
Constabulary from other parts of the Archipelago were brought in to do
the work. But he took the slight philosophically, feeling that, as a
matter of fact, he would much sooner not have anything to do with the
hunting down of Felizardo, a view in which his men concurred heartily.
He knew Bush and his company were going&mdash;Mrs Bush had told him so,
in the latest of those letters which were now the great interest of his
life&mdash;but the news did not move him, knowing, as he did, that the
chances of any fighting were extremely small.</p>
<p>It was two days after the meeting between Felizardo and Commissioner
Furber that Basil heard the result of the expedition. Even then, all he
got was a brief note from Lieutenant Stott at Catarman:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Felizardo escaped after all, simply laughed at
them, and rode down to Furber&rsquo;s camp, where he gave the
Commissioner the fright of his life, and hanged your old friend, the
Presidente of Igut. That is all I know yet. Will let you have details
when they come in. They are sending all the troops back to
Manila.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basil laid the note down with a sigh of relief. He knew now which
way his sympathies really lay. After all, life at Silang would have
seemed very drab and dreary had the fierce, chivalrous little man up on
the mountain-side been killed, or, worse still, captured.</p>
<p>It was from Mrs Bush that he received the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>first detailed account of the great drive, and
he smiled grimly to himself as he read of the dramatic ending of it
all, the sudden dash on horseback through the cordon of troops, the
equally sudden appearance at Commissioner Furber&rsquo;s camp, the
execution of the Presidente of Igut.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;My husband and his men saw nothing and did
nothing, save force their way through jungle and scramble over rocks.
They all came back very tired and cross. In fact, every one is tired
and cross, and in favour of leaving Felizardo alone for the future.
Still, the man who must decide, the Commissioner, says nothing.
Somehow, he seems to have changed, and every one is wondering what he
said to Felizardo, or what Felizardo said to him; but the only witness,
that hateful Presidente, cannot tell us now.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basil read the letter several times; then sat down and cursed things
in general, and Silang in particular, which was extremely illogical. If
he had cursed anything, he should have cursed his own folly in falling
in love with a married woman, who was far too proud ever to be more
than a friend to him; but, as I said before, when men, and women too,
live under the shadow of a place like Felizardo&rsquo;s mountain, and
have the Law of the Bolo as the background of their lives, they are apt
to become illogical, or even rash, and to do things which are never
supposed to be done in civilised countries. Basil&rsquo;s conduct was
the more foolish, and therefore <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211"
href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>the more indefensible,
because he was convinced that, even if Bush were to be eliminated by
means of the bolo, he himself would be no better off&mdash;worse even,
for Mrs Bush would then go back to the States, and he would see her no
more. All these things he would have seen and reasoned out, had he been
amongst ordinary surroundings; or, at least, he ought to have done so,
just as Mrs Bush would have seen the danger, and impropriety even, of
writing to a man her husband loathed; but the fact remains that they
did these unwise things, and were very miserable in consequence. They
could not settle their love affairs as Felizardo had settled his, many
years before, with a slash of the bolo&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>When Commissioner Furber got back to Manila he set his face hard,
expecting to meet with veiled jeers and gibes; but, though men did
rejoice over his failure, they did not do so in his presence, possibly
because they saw that, for the time at least, he was a broken man. Even
his colleagues showed considerable forbearance, saving only
Commissioner Gumpertz, who, having discovered that the operations
against Felizardo had already cost three million dollars, which might
have gone to more deserving objects, such as himself, was mightily
annoyed, and went to Mr Furber&rsquo;s office to tell him so.</p>
<p>However, he did not say it all; in fact, he had hardly got into his
main argument before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212"
name="pb212">212</a>]</span>he found it wiser to stop altogether,
though, instead of taking his colleague&rsquo;s advice and finishing it
outside the door, he hurried back to his own office and vented his
spleen on his clerks. None the less, he scored off Commissioner Furber
at the meeting of the Commission on the following day.</p>
<p>The Governor-General himself brought up the question of Felizardo.
&ldquo;What do you propose as your next move, Commissioner?&rdquo; he
said to Furber.</p>
<p>The latter did not hesitate. &ldquo;I have no further move in
contemplation,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Mr Gumpertz leaned forward. &ldquo;May I ask why?&rdquo; he enquired
with dangerous politeness.</p>
<p>The Commissioner for Constabulary and Trade addressed his answer to
the Governor, ignoring the other. &ldquo;I see no use in further
expeditions. They will do no good. We have done our best; but we have
been mistaken all along. Felizardo would have done us no harm had we
left him alone. He is an old man now, as I have seen for myself. He
wishes for peace, and I should grant it to him.&rdquo; He spoke slowly,
coldly, decisively, as a man whose mind was made up.</p>
<p>The other Commissioners exchanged glances, and the Governor spoke in
an unusually severe tone. &ldquo;It was your department, Commissioner,
which started these expeditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furber nodded. &ldquo;Yes, my department. I myself take full
responsibility for them, though <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213"
href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>I have been misled all
through by some of our native officials here in Manila. It is to them
that I shall give my attention now. I learnt a good many things whilst
I was out this time. We have carried our philanthropy too
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the Commissioners exchanged glances. Could this be the same
man who had been the one really sincere and pro-native amongst them, at
whom they had always laughed amongst themselves, because he thought of
his principles and not his pocket? But the Governor-General was growing
angry. He, at least, had to stand or fall by the Little Brown Brother
theory of Radical Equality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing, Commissioner,&rdquo; he said, with a veiled insult
in his voice, &ldquo;supposing the Commission decides not to make peace
with this old scoundrel, but to continue operations. It will still be
the work of your department to carry those out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commissioner laid his winning card on the table. &ldquo;My
department will carry out no more expeditions of the kind whilst I
remain head of it. I should resign first.&rdquo; He spoke very quietly,
knowing well that they dare not force his resignation, and so allow him
to return to the United States, and tell many things to the President,
whose personal friend he was, or, more terrible still, tell them to the
Press.</p>
<p>But though he could refuse to send out further <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>expeditions&mdash;and he knew well that the Army
authorities would refuse too&mdash;he could not open peace negotiations
without the consent of the Commission, and that question was adjourned
indefinitely.</p>
<p>Commissioner Gumpertz tried one parting shot. &ldquo;What about the
three million dollars your &lsquo;mistake&rsquo; has cost?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>His colleague&rsquo;s composure remained unruffled. &ldquo;They are
spent,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>The Governor-General corrected him mildly. &ldquo;Wasted, you mean,
perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furber smiled. &ldquo;I thank you, Governor. They have been wasted,
I should have said; and also many good lives. But&rdquo;&mdash;and for
once he looked them all squarely in the face, with flashing
eyes&mdash;&ldquo;I am not the only man here who has made mistakes, and
wasted money and lives. And&rdquo;&mdash;his glance travelled from the
Governor to Commissioner Gumpertz, and from Commissioner Gumpertz to
Commissioner Johnson, and on to Commissioner George&mdash;&ldquo;I have
never been accused of graft;&rdquo; then, regardless of etiquette, he
got up abruptly and left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid his nerves have been a little tried by his recent
experiences.&rdquo; The Governor-General sighed. &ldquo;He must see a
doctor. And now has any one a proposition to make regarding this
Felizardo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Gumpertz had been building <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>great hopes on the capture of Felizardo, arguing
that, once the band of outlaws was destroyed, the destruction of the
head-hunters, who had so nearly secured a trophy at the expense of Mr
Joseph Gobbitt, would become a simple matter. Then, those hemp lands on
the northern side of Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains would acquire a
commercial value, which meant that he himself would rake in a very
considerable sum over the selling of them. Consequently, he was very
greatly opposed to the principle of leaving Felizardo alone.
&ldquo;There is a way,&rdquo; he said, in answer to the
Governor-General&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;We should offer a large
reward for the old brigand&rsquo;s head, say five thousand dollars,
gold. We know that Commissioner Furber&rsquo;s department managed to
bribe two of the band to give information; and a big reward like this
should soon bring in the scoundrel&rsquo;s head. It is far cheaper than
expeditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They discussed the matter, not at very great length, and the result
of their discussions was seen the following morning, when bills were
posted in Manila itself offering five thousand dollars, United States
currency, for the head of Felizardo, the outlaw of the mountains; and
other copies of that proclamation were sent to Igut, and Catarman, and
Silang, though at the latter place they went straight on to the
fire.</p>
<p>The Army, seeing the bills, shook its head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
properly low down,&rdquo; it said&mdash;&ldquo;a pitiful <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>confession of weakness. As if there wasn&rsquo;t
enough treachery already, without making it into a profitable
trade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Furber, interviewed by the Press on the subject,
declined to make any statement. &ldquo;I have nothing to say,&rdquo; he
answered to the enquiries. &ldquo;The proclamation does not emanate
from my department&#8202;&hellip;. No, I have no opinion to
offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The change in the Commissioner&rsquo;s views had, perhaps, been too
sudden to last long. The shock of the meeting with Felizardo, the
contact with a personality infinitely stronger than his own, the
striking contrast between the old outlaw and the servile, lying
mestizos of Manila, could not fail to leave some permanent result
behind, some readjustment of his ideas on the native question; whilst
the discovery of how he had been deceived and misled as to
Felizardo&rsquo;s character and the strength of his band, with the
consequent waste of money and lives, was always a very bitter memory to
him, as the mestizos found to their cost. On the other hand, the public
saw little outward signs of change; he was too deeply, and it must be
said, sincerely, committed to the Party and its policy, to make any
open renunciations, and it was only in the higher official circles, and
in the councils of the insurrecto leaders, that they realised how great
an effect the interview with Felizardo had produced on Commissioner
Furber. Basil Hayle, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217"
name="pb217">217</a>]</span>however, perceived it on the occasion of
his next interview with his official chief, and wrote of it to Mrs
Bush, who replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I knew when he came back from Katubig that
time, after he had met the old chief, that he was a different
man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weeks passed without any news of Felizardo; and the Commission was
beginning to fear that its offer for his head had been made in vain,
when, in some mysterious way, rumours began to float round concerning
the breaking-up of the band. The old man had grown so suspicious, it
was said, that the others would stand him no longer, and now he was
practically alone. The hopes of his enemies rose high at the news,
which was confirmed a few days later by the announcement that overtures
for pardon had actually been made by the mutineers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the beginning of the end,&rdquo; Commissioner Gumpertz
said to his secretary, William P. Hart. &ldquo;When Felizardo is
finished with, we can get the head-hunters cleared out, and then sell
that hemp land. It&rsquo;ll be easy as falling off a log
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a week after these words were spoken that two natives,
ordinary tao by their appearance, came in with a large native basket,
made their way to the Police headquarters, and asked for the
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; the latter demanded.</p>
<p>The elder of the strangers pointed to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>basket. &ldquo;We have brought the head, Senor,
the head of Felizardo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo; The captain jumped out of his chair.
&ldquo;What do you bring the beastly thing in here for? Never mind,
though. Wait a minute,&rdquo; and he went to the telephone-box, where
he rang up Commissioner Furber.</p>
<p>The answer came back in a curt tone. &ldquo;The matter is nothing to
do with this department. I will not interfere, nor must you. Send them
with a guide over to Commissioner Gumpertz&rsquo; office. I believe he
has the affair in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police captain whistled. &ldquo;Phew! He&rsquo;s in a sweet
temper. Glad I didn&rsquo;t go and see him myself;&rdquo; then he
called a native constable, and put the two tao and their ghastly burden
in his charge.</p>
<p>Mr Gumpertz was pleased&mdash;in fact he was more than pleased,
delighted; but, none the less, he did not care to inspect the trophy.
Instead, he sent for his secretary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can identify this thing, Hart?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Mr Hart scratched his head. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s Furber, of
course, but I guess he wouldn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s mighty sore about it
all. See here, I&rsquo;ll get De Vega to have a look round. There must
be some one in the town who knew him by sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was curious how many people there were who had actually seen, and
even spoken to, Felizardo; some had been prisoners in his camp,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>others had done business with him during the
Spanish times. Senor de Vega picked six out of twenty or so, all men he
knew personally, for whose honour he could vouch, and brought them back
to the Palace. Then they took the basket into a small room, and set the
head on a table, and all of those six reliable witnesses declared on
their oath that it was the head of Felizardo. So there was great
rejoicing, and the Press published obituary notices, and the two tao
received much praise, and five thousand dollars in United States
currency. Yet, curiously enough, those two tao did not go back to the
unnamed village whence they had come; but instead made their way to a
house in the suburbs, where, that same evening, they were joined by
Senor de Vega and all the six witnesses, and the five thousand dollars
were forthwith divided into nine parts. Then each man went on his way
rejoicing, his pockets bulging with notes.</p>
<p>Up in the Palace, however, Commissioner Furber was almost unsafe to
approach, though both the Governor-General and Commissioner Gumpertz
were more than usually genial. A week later the position of affairs was
somewhat different, for Basil Hayle had sent in a certain dispatch
through Lieutenant Stott at Catarman. It ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The report of Felizardo&rsquo;s death as having
occurred some ten days ago is untrue. I have the best of reasons
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>for knowing, as, only this morning, I received a
communication from him, warning me that certain mestizos and natives of
Manila had secured the head of a cousin of his own, who had recently
died at Calocan, and that they were bringing this in with the idea of
claiming the reward for his, Felizardo&rsquo;s, head. I am sending this
by special runner to Catarman, and trust it will reach you in
time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the secretary came in a few minutes later in answer to his
chief&rsquo;s bell, he found the Commissioner actually smiling.
&ldquo;Make copies of this letter, Jones,&rdquo; he said&mdash;he had
finished with mestizo secretaries&mdash;&ldquo;and send one to each
member of the Commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the next meeting of the Commission, the Governor-General brought
up the subject. &ldquo;It was rather an unfortunate proposal of yours,
Commissioner Gumpertz. It is a pity that when you made it, you did not
think of a contingency like this. We left it to you, as you will
remember. Most unfortunate, throwing good money after bad; and, though
we know, or think we know, the culprits, we should all look foolish if
we were to prosecute. It is obvious we can accomplish nothing in this
way; and though I do not think we should go as far as Commissioner
Furber suggests, and make peace with Felizardo, I think that, for the
time being at least, it would be wiser to suspend all operations, and
only attack him if he leaves the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, for a space, Felizardo was left alone. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER X</h2>
<h2 class="main">HOW FELIZARDO WENT BACK TO SAN POLYCARPIO</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One of the results of the new policy towards Felizardo
was a decision to abandon the post at Silang, which, never of any great
value, had now become quite useless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;You will take over the command at
Calocan,&rdquo; Commissioner Furber wrote to Captain Hayle. &ldquo;The
officer who is there now is going to the Island of Leyte, and you will
replace him. There are good quarters in what used to be the barracks of
the Guardia <span class="corr" id="xd25e2466" title=
"Source: Civile">Civil</span>. You had better march overland, as we
cannot spare a coastguard steamer at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basil received the news joyfully. He was utterly weary of doing
nothing, and seeing nobody, at Silang; moreover, at Calocan he would at
least be in touch with Igut, where Mrs Bush was; whilst, most important
of all, the route overland to Calocan lay through Igut. His men also
were pleased. There were stores and spirit shops at Calocan,
institutions conspicuous by their absence at Silang, whilst some
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>of the company, at least, had already made an
impression on the local inhabitants of the new station, when they had
acted as guard during the hanging of Juan Vagas and his
fellow-insurrectos, loading with ball cartridge to keep the swaying
crowd in order. They would be able to swagger through the streets, and
attract the attention of all the prettiest girls, especially if, as
seemed likely, their captain succeeded in getting new uniforms issued
to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better burn the stockade, Senor,&rdquo; the old
serjeant said, when he was told of the forthcoming move. &ldquo;If we
leave it, who knows but that some ladrone band may use it as
headquarters, and then it will be no easy task to retake it.&rdquo; So
they collected brushwood and grass and piled it high against the walls,
and when the last man had left, Basil himself set fire to it, greatly
to the disgust of some of the young men of Silang village, who had
already decided to make the place into a robbers&rsquo; castle.</p>
<p>Up on Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains they saw the smoke, and reported
the fact to the old chief, who nodded and said: &ldquo;I am glad.
Silang was no place for a brave man like that. Down at Calocan, which I
know well, he may find work to do. There are insurrectos in the town
itself, and ladrones in the bush, the two working hand in hand.
Possibly, he may build up the gallows again, for the third time. Who
knows? There are many in Calocan who need hanging, even <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>as
it used to be thirty-six years ago, when I worked in the warehouse of
Don Jos&eacute; Ramirez. The old corporal of the Guardia <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e2480" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span> kept order
well in those days, and I think this young captain of the Constabulario
will keep order too. They need a strong man. There should always be a
gallows at Calocan, as I, Felizardo, have reason to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil halted for the night at Igut, staying with Don Juan Ramirez,
but he did not have a meal in Mrs Bush&rsquo;s house, nor did she ask
him to stay for one, Captain Bush himself being away at San Francisco,
higher up the valley. Still, they had a long talk, sitting out on the
balcony, where all men might see them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you wrote,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;I wanted
to do so myself often, but, somehow, I was afraid to begin. What made
you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked away towards Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains. &ldquo;I had
news for you,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, &ldquo;the news of what
had happened up on the mountain-side, where my husband and Lieutenant
Vigne went after the outlaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while neither of them spoke. Then &ldquo;They are the only
letters I get,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;There is no one else,
there never was any one else, and there never will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Bush did not look round. It was the first time he had given any
hint of his feelings, at least in words, and she dare not let him see
her face, distrusting herself. When at last <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>she
did speak it was of her husband. &ldquo;I am sorry John is away,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;you might have liked to hear his account of the great
and inglorious expedition against Felizardo&#8202;&hellip;. And so you
are going to Calocan. It will not be so dull there as at Silang. You
will be much nearer Manila. Calocan&mdash;was not that where they
executed those insurrectos who tried to burn this town? Yes, I thought
so. You were going to tell me one day why you were so bitter against
that man Vagas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil muttered something inaudible, and got up suddenly, whereupon
Mrs Bush, feeling she had already punished him sufficiently for his
outburst, for which she was partially responsible, made him sit down
again, and from that point onwards they avoided dangerous subjects.
Only, when he got back to Don Juan&rsquo;s, the old Spaniard&rsquo;s
quick eyes saw that there was something wrong, and knowing much
concerning Captain Bush, was sorry for Mrs Bush and Basil Hayle. Still,
as he said to himself, it was a good thing that the Constabulary
officer was not quartered in Igut itself, for any man with eyes in his
head could see that, perhaps unknown to himself, Basil Hayle had become
a convert to the code of the Bolo, and that, sooner or later, he would
kill Captain Bush. His very quietness was in itself a dangerous sign;
or at least old Don Juan, who knew most things connected with such
matters, looked on it in that light. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span></p>
<p>Basil saw Mrs Bush once more, early on the following morning. He had
drawn his men up in the plaza, and was about to start, when he caught
sight of her in the doorway of her house. He told the old serjeant to
march the company off down the Calocan road, then himself went across
the square to say farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it <i>au revoir</i> again?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush nodded. &ldquo;Of course. It is always <i>au
revoir</i>&mdash;with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you send to me if anything happens? I can get over in a
few hours by boat,&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush tried to smile. &ldquo;What should happen? And yet,&rdquo;
her eyes grew suspiciously soft, &ldquo;you came once before, when I
had not sent, on the morning of the great fight in the plaza here, and
saved us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil flushed. &ldquo;So you will send?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
<p>She held out her hand. &ldquo;Yes, I will send&mdash;if
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he hurried after his men, and in due course marched them into
Calocan, where he took possession of the old barracks of the Guardia
<span class="corr" id="xd25e2521" title="Source: Civile">Civil</span>,
in which the Spanish corporal had lived for many years. The people of
Calocan had hewn down and burned the new gallows, which he had caused
to be erected a few months before; and when he made his first tour of
inspection round the town, the men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226"
href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>shambled away, cursing under
their breath, whilst some of the women shouted &ldquo;Hangman.&rdquo;
But Basil did not trouble, remembering who it was he had
hanged&mdash;Juan Vagas, whose share of the plunder of Igut was to have
been Mrs Bush. His men, on the other hand, did not take matters so
quietly, and there were many bruised heads and sore backs in Calocan
before an understanding was reached.</p>
<p>Before Basil had been at Calocan a week, the old Spanish priest
died, and there came to replace him a young American, Father Doyle. As
the latter was the only other white man in the place&mdash;unless one
included, as no sane man would do, Messrs <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e2528" title="Source: Lippman">Lippmann</span> &amp; Klosky, who
now occupied old Don Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s premises, opposite the site of
the gallows&mdash;there presently sprang up a great friendship between
the Constabulary officer and the padre, and, although they were of
different creeds, the priest soon learnt of the great secret, or rather
the great sorrow, in the other&rsquo;s life, and, being broad-minded,
sympathised with him deeply, which, possibly, like Basil&rsquo;s
infatuation itself, was most wrong and improper.</p>
<p>Father Doyle had been in Calocan a couple of months when the chance
of his lifetime came. Probably most men, nine out of ten perhaps, have
one great chance, sooner or later; and yet it is doubtful whether one
in ten realises when that chance has come, and whether one in a hundred
profits by it to the full. Some are so <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>amazed that they rush
off to discuss it with their friends, or stay at home and ponder over
it, until the psychological moment has passed; others are too dull, or
too heart-broken, to understand that it has come at all, having often
got beyond the stage when hope is a living thing; whilst yet others are
suddenly filled with a blind self-confidence which ruins
everything.</p>
<p>Father Doyle&rsquo;s chance came in the form of a message from
Felizardo, brought to Calocan by no less a person than old Don Juan
Ramirez, the nephew of that Don Jos&eacute; Ramirez whose junior clerk
Felizardo had once been. Dolores Lasara was dying, and Felizardo wanted
a priest&mdash;a white priest, not a mestizo like the padre at Igut, or
like Father Pablo, whom Felizardo himself had slain in the house of the
Teniente of San Polycarpio.</p>
<p>Don Juan found Father Doyle in the old barracks, dining with Basil
Hayle, and delivered his message at once, adding: &ldquo;I have a
launch waiting to take you as far as Katubig. A Scotchman, John Mackay,
a hemp-planter, will be waiting there to go up with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Doyle, who had risen from his seat, looked from Don Juan to
Basil Hayle, a question in his eyes. &ldquo;But this
Felizardo&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old chief&rsquo;s word can be trusted. He will not harm
you,&rdquo; Basil said, and then was sorry he had spoken, for that was
not the question at all. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href=
"#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not thinking of that. It never occurred to me,&rdquo;
the priest answered simply. &ldquo;I was thinking that this man had
killed a priest, and was outside the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Juan, understanding the momentary confusion in the other&rsquo;s
mind, laid a hand on his arm. &ldquo;Dolores Lasara never killed a
priest, Father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it is Dolores who is
dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the launch was on its way to Katubig. Basil went
down to the beach to see them off. He was longing to ask Don Juan about
Mrs Bush; but, somehow, he could not get the words out, and the old
Spaniard, being fully occupied with the matter in hand, forgot to
mention the Scout officer&rsquo;s wife; although he had intended to
tell the Constabulary officer how, on hearing that Dolores Lasara was
at the point of death, Mrs Bush had volunteered herself to go up to the
mountains and nurse her, knowing, as she did, of the great love there
had been between Felizardo and the daughter of the Teniente of San
Polycarpio. But if Don Juan did not tell Basil Hayle then, he told
Felizardo himself later, and the old chief did not forget, as he proved
afterwards.</p>
<p>At Katubig, which was now being rebuilt, they found John Mackay, who
had been Mr Joseph Gobbitt&rsquo;s companion in the adventure of the
head-hunters. Also, they found half a dozen of Felizardo&rsquo;s men
and three horses. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229"
name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not far,&rdquo; the leader of the outlaws said.
&ldquo;If the Reverend Father and the other Senors do not mind
travelling in the dark, we shall be there in two hours. The road is
easy enough for horses&mdash;when one knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they rode into the darkness, up the mountain-side by an easy
trail, the existence of which no man would have suspected, and at last
they came to Felizardo&rsquo;s own dwelling, a large cave with an
entrance screened by great boulders. Inside, a number of rooms were
partitioned off, and in the largest of these Dolores Lasara lay
dying.</p>
<p>Felizardo himself met them outside, looking as an old man does look
when the greatest sorrow of his life is coming upon him; but his eyes
brightened when he saw the priest. &ldquo;I thank you, my
friends,&rdquo; he said to Don Juan and John Mackay. Then he saluted
the priest. &ldquo;You are an American, Father?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Father Doyle nodded. &ldquo;I am an American, yes; but first I am a
priest of the Holy Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad&rdquo;&mdash;the old man spoke almost
dreamily&mdash;&ldquo;I am glad, because the Americans are a strong
people, who will rule these Islands well in the end, when they have
learnt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Then suddenly he pulled himself together.
&ldquo;I have sent for you to marry me, Father,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Don Juan and John Mackay exchanged looks <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>of
utter surprise; but the priest kept his composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are at war with the
Holy Church. How can I give you absolution after you have killed a
priest?&rdquo; His voice was very low, and full of pity and a bitter
sorrow.</p>
<p>Felizardo&rsquo;s tone also was low when he answered: &ldquo;I will
confess, Father, and when you have heard all you will give me
absolution. I swore, when I slew Father Pablo, that I would never have
aught to do with priests again; but now it is for the sake of Dolores,
and that alters everything.&rdquo; For the first time since he had
taken to the hills, Felizardo&rsquo;s voice broke a little; then, after
a pause, he went on proudly, almost defiantly: &ldquo;But first I will
ask some questions of these Senors, who, as you know, would not lie,
even though I, Felizardo the outlaw, might do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Doyle sat down on one of the boulders, and rested his chin on
his hand. He, at least, was amongst those who know when a great chance
has come, and he listened with almost breathless anxiety for the
questions and the answers. He was a judge of men, as a priest should
be, and he realised that, as Felizardo had said, neither the Scotchman
nor the Spaniard would lie. Curiously enough, the fact that they were
in the outlaw&rsquo;s own camp, with probably hundreds of bolomen
within call, struck none <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>of them. They never gave a thought
to the idea of treachery on the part of Felizardo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened in Calocan, Senor, the night I left there? You
were young then, very young, but perhaps you remember.&rdquo; Felizardo
looked at Don Juan as he spoke, and the old Spaniard in turn looked
towards the priest when he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fought the ladrones, Cinicio Dagujob&rsquo;s band, fought
them single-handed, and saved the life and the money of my uncle, Don
Jos&eacute; Ramirez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I slew Father Pablo, the priest of San Polycarpio,
whom did I slay also?&rdquo; There was a note of fierceness in the old
man&rsquo;s voice now.</p>
<p>The answer came at once, spoken slowly and deliberately, so that
each word should tell. &ldquo;You slew a man who, besides being a
priest, was also one of the leaders of the band of Cinicio Dagujob, the
ladrone, who sought to put shame on Dolores Lasara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And since I have been on the hills have I ever harmed the
tao? Even in the first years did I not only levy tribute on those who
were oppressing the people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Juan nodded. &ldquo;That is so;&rdquo; and John Mackay nodded
too.</p>
<p>Father Doyle rose. &ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; he said; and he went
into the cave with Felizardo, and, having heard his confession, gave
him absolution, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232"
name="pb232">232</a>]</span>being a man who, having no other interest
in life save the service of his Master, was not afraid of what other
men might say concerning him. So, at last, after thirty-six years,
Dolores Lasara was married to Felizardo by Father Doyle, the American
priest, in the presence of old Don Juan Ramirez the Spaniard, and John
Mackay the Scotchman. Then the two latter went outside, and sat by a
fire in the open, and waited for dawn, when Father Doyle came out and
told them that the gentle, faithful soul of the wife of Felizardo had
gone to its own place.</p>
<p>Presently Felizardo came out also, looking a very old man for his
years, and saw to their wants with a grave courtesy, making no mention
of his loss until he had arranged everything for them; then, &ldquo;I
shall bury my wife at San Polycarpio, where she was born,&rdquo; he
said very quietly.</p>
<p>Don Juan gave an exclamation of surprise, foreseeing the
difficulties, but Father Doyle nodded sympathetically, whilst John
Mackay rose from his seat at once. &ldquo;Then I had better see Basil
Hayle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Calocan is but a mile or two by water
from San Polycarpio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about the Scouts at Igut?&rdquo; Don Juan&rsquo;s
voice was full of anxiety. &ldquo;If they heard and made an attack,
what would happen then? Why not tell Captain Bush also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Felizardo shook his head. &ldquo;They will not hear. We shall pass
Igut in the night; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href=
"#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>even if they did
attack&mdash;well, there will be bolomen, though I want peace above all
things, if only for this journey. You say, &lsquo;Tell Captain
Bush,&rsquo; Senor. No, he is not like the Captain of the Constabulary.
He could not understand, treating his own wife as he does. I know,
Senor, even about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So no word went down to Igut concerning the death of Dolores and
Felizardo&rsquo;s intention of burying her in her own birthplace, San
Polycarpio; but John Mackay hastened to Calocan, and saw Basil Hayle,
to whom he told the whole matter.</p>
<p>Basil stroked his moustache thoughtfully. &ldquo;I shall be there
myself,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;and I will take those of my men
who escaped from the fight on the hillside, when Felizardo cut my
company to pieces. They will go, not as guard to me, but as a guard of
honour to the body of Felizardo&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Mackay looked at him curiously. Somehow, he had never suspected
Captain Hayle of being sentimental, but at that time he had heard
nothing concerning the friendship between Mrs Bush and his host;
otherwise, he would have known that any man who honoured his own wife
was Basil Hayle&rsquo;s friend, just as Captain Bush was his enemy.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when they started down the
mountain-side with the body of Dolores, and it was already dark when
they skirted round <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234"
name="pb234">234</a>]</span>Igut town. There were nearly a hundred
bolomen in the procession when it left the mountains, and ten more
joined it from Katubig, and twenty from Igut itself, greatly to the
surprise of old Don Juan, who recognised two of his own warehousemen
amongst them. The Spaniard was going through to San Polycarpio, because
Felizardo was an old acquaintance, almost an old friend, because
Felizardo and Dolores Lasara had, somehow, always been in the
background of his life, and because now he felt that a definite factor
had gone out of his life. He sighed heavily as he thought of it. Like
Felizardo, he was growing old. It was time he went back to Spain. He
had one advantage over the outlaw, he told himself, in that he had no
wife whose death would make the rest of his existence a mere waiting
for death, in the hope of reunion. Then suddenly it struck him that,
after all, Felizardo was more fortunate, for he had a child, whilst Don
Juan Ramirez of Igut was the last of the family. All those things the
Spaniard thought of, as he rode by Father Doyle&rsquo;s side through
the long night.</p>
<p>Father Doyle went with the procession because it was his duty. It
was therefore a matter of total indifference to him whether or no the
Government learnt of his action and showed its annoyance. He was not
responsible to the Philippine Commission for what he did in his
capacity as priest. He owed allegiance to a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>very
different Power. As for his actions of the previous night, his mind was
at rest on that point. He had acted according to his own conscience,
and he told himself with a sigh that if he could have given absolution
to the Commissioners themselves with as little hesitation as he had
given it to Felizardo the outlaw, it would have been a good augury for
the future of the Islands.</p>
<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock in the morning when they reached San
Polycarpio. Felizardo drew a deep breath, possibly to choke back a sob,
as he looked round in the moonlight. He had not been there for
thirty-six years, not since he had fled to the bush, carrying Dolores
Lasara in his arms, after having slain Father Pablo, the parish priest
and ladrone. It still looked the same. It had been just such another
moonlight night on that occasion. There seemed to be no new buildings;
no more bush had been cleared. The village was sleeping as it had slept
that night, whilst he was doing the deed which was to make him an
outlaw. Nothing had changed in San Polycarpio&mdash;only he was an old
man, and Dolores his wife was dead. That was all.</p>
<p>They had brought spades and pickaxes to dig a grave, but when they
arrived at the burial-ground, lo, there was one ready, on a rise, under
a big tree, with its foot towards Felizardo&rsquo;s own mountains,
behind which the sun would rise. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236"
href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>A tall man and a short, stout priest were standing near the grave,
whilst in the background were some fifteen native soldiers, who saluted
as the body went by.</p>
<p>Felizardo dismounted and came forward. The priest began to tremble,
having heard of what had happened to a certain predecessor of his when
Felizardo was last in San Polycarpio; but Basil Hayle held out his
hand, and he and the outlaw actually met at last, yet, even now, there
was no word spoken, though they walked side by side to the church.</p>
<p>Then Basil fell behind and whispered to Father Doyle: &ldquo;I made
the parish priest come out&mdash;he was half-dead with
fear&mdash;because I was not sure if you would be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Doyle nodded. &ldquo;It was his duty in any case. This is his
parish, not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they buried Dolores, the wife of Felizardo, in the graveyard of
San Polycarpio, with her face towards the mountains where her womanhood
had been passed. Dawn was just breaking when they had finished, and
then they all drew back, and left the old chief kneeling beside the
grave, where he remained until the first ray of sunlight came from
behind the mountains and struck the newly-turned earth, when he got up
and came towards them, and they saw that there was a look of peace on
his face.</p>
<p>Then he shook hands with Father Doyle and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>with
Don Juan and with Basil Hayle, and disappeared with his men into the
bush, taking a circuitous route back to the mountains, which was
fortunate, for Captain Bush, having heard a rumour of his going to San
Polycarpio, and being still sore over his own defeat, had arranged an
ambush for him, of which Felizardo heard in due course, and did not
forget. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2 class="main">HOW THE BOLO OF FELIZARDO CUT A KNOT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many things which happen in the jungle can be kept
secret; but a matter like the burying of Dolores in the graveyard of
San Polycarpio must become known. They heard of it in Manila the
following day, from native sources, and the Press made out of it a
great story, which was also perfectly inaccurate, as is usually the
case when the information comes through mestizos, people to whom truth
is a thing either hateful or unknown.</p>
<p>Felizardo had descended on San Polycarpio with the whole of his
band; he had slain the local police, and confined the inhabitants to
their houses; had taken the parish priest from his bed, and compelled
him, at the point of the bolo, to read the Burial Service; then he had
hanged the Teniente of San Polycarpio over the grave, and after that
had departed, swearing to return and burn the village itself, if any
one dared to interfere with the body <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>of his
wife&mdash;such was the gist of the first account circulated round
Manila.</p>
<p>The insurrecto party, which had sorrowed greatly over the suspension
of operations against Felizardo, and over Commissioner Furber&rsquo;s
new attitude of suspicion, held a special meeting to discuss the
situation, seeing a chance of forcing on a fresh campaign against the
Chief of the Mountains, who was such a deadly enemy of the Sovereign
People. It was even suggested that the Teniente of San Polycarpio
should actually be hanged, in order to give an air of reality to the
whole story. Unfortunately, however, the ex-general of the Army of
Liberty, who made the proposal, forgot, or did not know, that the man
sitting opposite to him happened to be a brother to that same Teniente.
They got the knife away from the Teniente&rsquo;s brother before any
serious harm was done; but, none the less, the meeting broke up in
disorder, without having arrived at any definite decision.</p>
<p>The <i>Herald</i> and the <i>Record</i> seized on the story eagerly.
Copy was short that day, and this news seemed to offer such splendid
opportunities in the way of headlines; but Clancy of the <i>Star</i>
was suspicious, and would not use it without confirmation. &ldquo;Get a
launch and go across to Calocan,&rdquo; he said to his most reliable
reporter. &ldquo;You may induce Basil Hayle to talk. He is sure to know
all about it, in fact there&rsquo;s a rumour that he himself was at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>burial. If he won&rsquo;t tell you anything,
which is very probable, go on to San Polycarpio itself, and see the
priest. I would sooner have the right story to-morrow than use any of
this rubbish to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news caused a good deal of commotion in official circles. The
Governor-General looked worried, thinking of the hopeless state into
which the finances had got&mdash;as was inevitable, considering the
class of man which the Party was sending out&mdash;and wondering
whether it would now be necessary to resume those ruinously expensive
expeditions against the outlaws, in which case some of the officials
would have to be content with their bare salaries, as there would be
nothing else left to divide; and that, of course, would mean trouble,
and complaints to the Party managers. Already, Commissioner Gumpertz
was showing a nasty spirit, as was also Commissioner Johnson, and it
had been necessary to give them, or rather their nominees, a contract
for a long and utterly useless road to the hills, in order to keep them
quiet. Moreover, as that road had to be paid for by loan, the Press had
got early information of it, and had said some things concerning the
contract which were very unpleasant, because perfectly true. Now, if,
as was rumoured, Felizardo was actually out on the warpath himself,
there would be fresh expenses, fresh anxieties about money matters.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span></p>
<p>Commissioner Gumpertz, on the other hand, having nothing to do with
the finances, except as regarded the share of them which he himself
got, was by no means displeased to hear of Felizardo&rsquo;s supposed
raid. He had never given up hope of being able ultimately to sell that
hemp land on the northern side of the outlaw&rsquo;s mountains; and if
he could revive the campaign against the old chief, he felt certain in
his own mind that this time it would be carried through to the end,
even though the President had to order the Army to assist.
Incidentally, too, the reopening of hostilities would be deadly to the
prestige of Commissioner Furber, and might possibly lead to his
resignation, in which case Mr Gumpertz was in hopes that the vacant
post would be filled by a certain ex-partner of his own, a most
admirable arrangement. As a result of these views, the Commissioner of
Lands and Registration was very ready to be interviewed by the Press on
the subject of Felizardo&rsquo;s latest exploit, and expressed his
opinions most forcibly. He had always been opposed to the new policy of
leaving this brigand alone, he said; and this outrage at San Polycarpio
went to prove that he had been right. It would be necessary now to
resume operations on a larger scale than ever. The Regular Army would
have to be called upon to provide troops, its chiefs being shown
plainly that they were, after all, merely the servants of the State,
and that it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>was not for them to say whether they would, or
would not, assist the Civil Government. The Commission must be supreme.
No individual member of it must be allowed to dictate to his
colleagues, and no murderer and outlaw, like Felizardo, must be allowed
to remain in a state of insolent independence. The present state of
affairs was an insult to the Flag, a violation of all the great
principles for which the Party stood.</p>
<p>True, the <i>Herald</i> headed its report of the interview,
&ldquo;Commissioner on the High Horse,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gumpertz gets on
the Great Gee-Gee,&rdquo; and thereby spoilt a good deal of the effect;
but still the Commissioner for Lands and Registration had the
satisfaction of knowing that he had got in the first blows both at his
own colleague and at Felizardo. Lower down on the same page the
<i>Herald</i> announced that Mr Furber declined to be interviewed.
&ldquo;The Commissioner looked cross,&rdquo; it stated, for once
telling the crude truth; but it did not dare to reproduce the remarks
which a certain highly-placed Army officer had made to its reporter
concerning Mr Gumpertz and his views.</p>
<p>Still, enough was published that day to set all Manila talking, and
when, on the following morning, a launch came in from Igut, bringing
Captain Bush&rsquo;s report of the affair, the sensation was even
greater; for Bush, having conveniently forgotten the good turn Basil
Hayle had once <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>done him in suppressing all mention of his
absence from the great fight in the plaza of Igut, now told the story
of how the Constabulary officer had been present at the burial of
Dolores, actually assisting Felizardo, instead of endeavouring to
arrest him. It was a venomous, damning report, full of the jealousy
which the man who had been a soldier felt of the man who would always
be a soldier, and, more important than that, of the jealousy which the
man who had made Mrs Bush&rsquo;s life utterly miserable felt of the
man who could have made her happy. True, some of the details given in
the first rumours, such as the hanging of the Teniente and the holding
up of the village, were not mentioned in the Scout officer&rsquo;s
version; but these omissions were hardly noticed in view of the
intensely interesting character of the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will certainly give Hayle the sack, even if they do not
bring him to trial,&rdquo; was the general opinion of Manila men who,
in most cases, added their conviction that Captain Bush was a low-down
cur, for, despite Basil&rsquo;s reticence, it had long since leaked out
unofficially that the Scout officer had been missing on the occasion of
the insurrecto attack, and had only appeared after the killing was
finished. Moreover, they knew his character pretty well in Manila, and
did not admire it greatly.</p>
<p>Bush himself had acted deliberately in the matter. He intended to
ruin Basil Hayle&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href=
"#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>career if possible, and the report
had been the result of the joint efforts of the Supervisor, the school
teacher, and himself. Its compilation had entailed the consumption of a
good deal of spirits, but when it had been finished, and sent down to
the skipper of the waiting launch, they all felt pleased with
themselves, for the Supervisor and the school teacher hated the man who
had saved their lives from Juan Vagas and his band almost as bitterly
as did the Scout officer, remembering what he had once said concerning
white men and mestizos. And then the school teacher said, jerking his
head in the direction of the lower end of the town: &ldquo;Shall we go
and tell them? They&rsquo;ll be mighty pleased to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bush got up, a little unsteadily, perhaps. &ldquo;No;
that&rsquo;ll do by and by. I&rsquo;m going to tell my wife
first;&rdquo; which seemed to the others such a good idea that they
laughed immoderately, and insisted that he should have another drink
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need it, old man,&rdquo; the Supervisor said;
and the Treasurer, who came in at that moment, and had the matter
explained to him, agreed.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush listened to her husband in absolute silence, in fact so
still did she sit that he finished lamely, almost apologetically:
&ldquo;It was my duty to report it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then her anger blazed out, and he cowered before it. &ldquo;Oh, you
coward! Your duty! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245"
name="pb245">245</a>]</span>Did he feel it his duty to report you when
he saved the town you were supposed to be defending, when he saved your
wife&rsquo;s honour at the hands of those brown fiends? Did he go into
Manila and tell where you had been that night, and why you were the
last man on the scene? To think I should have married you, when there
are so many real men in the world! Oh, go away, and never dare to speak
to me again. Go to the friends who are worthy of you&mdash;and to the
woman you have put in my place, the coloured woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possibly, for the first time, Bush realised something of the deadly
insult he had put on his wife, for he tried to defend himself in a
guilty man&rsquo;s way, with a counter-charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in love with Hayle. That&rsquo;s what makes you so
mad,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>She turned on him in superb scorn. &ldquo;And if I am, have you any
right to complain? Have you any right to speak to a white
woman&mdash;you cur!&rdquo; And then, in his rage, he struck her twice
on the mouth. She staggered back and sank into a chair, whilst he went
out, with an attempt at a swagger, forgetting that the natives in the
plaza&mdash;there were three sitting in the shade of the
belfry&mdash;could have seen all that had occurred on the balcony.</p>
<p>When he rejoined his friends in the spirit shop, they noticed that
he was flushed and his hand was a little shaky. &ldquo;I told her, and
she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>didn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; he said briefly.
The school teacher sniggered, whereupon Bush turned on him savagely.
&ldquo;Confound you, what are you laughing at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others exchanged glances, and hastened to start some entirely
fresh topic of conversation. Obviously, Bush had one of his bad fits
coming on, and they knew by experience how nasty he could be. More than
once, they had feared that he was going to quarrel with them finally,
which might have resulted in his making peace with his wife, in which
case many privileges they now enjoyed would have been curtailed, if not
actually withdrawn. So they endeavoured to smooth him down, and after a
while succeeded in their aim.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush did not cry, at least not at first. Instead, she went to
her room, and, after dabbing a little blood off her mouth, examined her
lip to see how badly it was cut, doing it all very quietly, as though
she were dazed. Then she sat down to think it out, right from the
beginning.</p>
<p>In a way, she blamed herself. She had known when she married John
Bush that the curse of drink was in his family; but she had been very
young then; she had believed she loved him; and believed, too, that she
could keep him straight. But she had found out her mistake as soon as
she rejoined him in Manila after the war. He was a marked man even
then, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>the Service, as the old General had told her
very gently; and, what was even worse, <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e2720" title="Source: find">finding</span> himself shunned by his
brother-officers, he had got into the hands of the baser class of civil
officials, who had not the slightest compunction about separating him
from his wife when it suited their ends to do so.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush had always made excuses for him to herself, so long as it
was only a case of that miserable hereditary tendency. She would get
him back to the States before long, and then she would be able to
reassert her influence over him; but when, through the introduction of
the school teacher, the other woman came on the scene, there, in Igut
itself, practically under her own eyes, she realised that any further
efforts of hers would be useless; the end of their married life had
come; although, until he came to boast to her that he had ruined Basil
Hayle&rsquo;s career, no mention of that other woman had passed her
lips. Even now, she was sorry she had demeaned herself by having spoken
as she had done. Probably, he would glory in the knowledge of how
sorely he had wounded her pride.</p>
<p>As for the blows on her mouth, they seemed, somehow, to be matters
of secondary consideration; in fact, when she came to think of them,
she was almost glad he had struck her. Relations between them were now
on a definite basis, the most definite basis of all, for no
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>reconciliation was possible. There would be no
more need to keep up appearances, to meet him, if not as a husband or
lover, at least on terms of politeness. That stage had been passed, as
she told herself with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>But when she thought of her own future movements the prospect was
far less satisfactory. She could see no way out of her difficulties.
She had not even the money to take her back to the United States; and
even if, as was probable, the General were to grant her free
transportation, she had no relatives who would give her a home. Two
aunts and half a dozen cousins were the only members of her family she
knew, and with these she had never been on good terms. She had very few
acquaintances in Manila, having been in the city but a few weeks; in
fact, the only friend she had, the only real friend, was Basil Hayle,
and to him she could not appeal, even though, in her own mind, she was
certain that his chivalry would prevent him from thinking any evil. It
was because she loved him, because she was not sure of herself, that
she could not ask him for aid.</p>
<p>She had promised to write to him &ldquo;if necessary,&rdquo; and
now, when a crisis which neither of them had foreseen had come, she
could not keep her promise.</p>
<p>There was one thing she could do, however, one thing she must
do&mdash;write and warn him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>concerning her husband&rsquo;s
report. She glanced out towards the harbour. The launch had already
gone, but the sea was like a mill-pond, and it would not take a canoe
long to reach Calocan.</p>
<p>She sat down and wrote hurriedly, in a tone very different from that
of her ordinary letters to Basil, for she was hot at the thought of how
her husband was repaying the other man&rsquo;s services. The result was
that, quite unconsciously, she betrayed her feelings to the man she
loved, and showed him that the breach between her husband and herself
was now wider than ever, so wide that it could never be crossed. But
she did not say a word of his coming to Igut, nor hint at the terrible
problem of her future which now had to be faced.</p>
<p>Still, none the less, Basil understood, and cursed the fate which
made it impossible for him to offer assistance, at any rate at the
moment. He was by no means a poor man, even though he might be serving
as an officer in the Philippines Constabulary, and he had but scant
regard for most conventions. On the other hand, he had the very
greatest regard for Mrs Bush&rsquo;s feelings, and he realised,
instinctively, that an offer from him might seem almost an insult, a
suggestion that she should put herself under his protection. When he
could see her it would be different, but that was also an impossibility
for the time being, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250"
name="pb250">250</a>]</span>especially as he felt certain he would be
summoned to Manila to explain the part he had played in the cemetery at
San Polycarpio.</p>
<p>For the greater part of the night, Basil sat, smoking innumerable
cigarettes, and conceiving, and then rejecting, innumerable plans. In
the end he wrote two letters, one to Mrs Bush and one to old Don Juan
Ramirez. The former was the most difficult he had ever attempted; he
wanted to say so much, and dared to say so little, the result being
that, as in her case, he unconsciously told everything, which was, of
course, extremely wrong, and must be attributed to the influence of the
Law of the Bolo.</p>
<p>To Don Juan he also told a great deal, this time with intention,
and, perhaps for that very reason, did not tell it well; although, as
he had foreseen, the old Spaniard knew most of it already, and was
deeply touched by the confidence. Basil wanted to learn exactly how
matters stood, what had occurred recently, how Mrs Bush looked, where
Bush spent his time and took his meals&mdash;a whole host of questions,
which caused Don Juan to knit his brows, and to wonder how many he dare
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I tell him the whole truth, he will certainly come and
kill the Scout officer, which would be very foolish.&rdquo; The
Spaniard sighed&mdash;he had heard what those natives who were sitting
in the shadow of the belfry had seen occur on the
balcony&mdash;&ldquo;So I will tell him <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>part, and leave the
rest to fate. Who knows? Matters may adjust themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he wrote discreetly, making the best of things, and after he had
sent the letter, called on Mrs Bush and tried to comfort her, speaking
as one who was almost old enough to be her grandfather, and was also a
gentleman of Spain, could speak; but when he came to mention Basil
Hayle he realised that this was a matter in which words were not of
much avail, for, possibly, again, because of that most demoralising Law
of the Bolo, Mrs Bush was losing all sense of the sanctity of
conventions. Still, the visit was not a waste of time, for, when he
took his leave, she knew that she had yet another very sincere friend,
one who was always close at hand.</p>
<p>Don Juan&rsquo;s letter followed Basil to Manila, whither he had
been summoned to give an explanation of his doings on the night
Felizardo buried his wife. Basil smiled grimly as he opened the
envelope. He had been expecting something of the kind from the outset,
and he was quite ready to face the trouble. When Father Doyle came in
later that evening, Basil tossed the paper across to him. &ldquo;What
do you think of that, Father?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s face grew grave. &ldquo;I am sorry. It may be
unpleasant for you. And you need not have gone. I was there because it
was my duty; but you&mdash;&mdash;<span class="corr" id="xd25e2758"
title="Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Basil cut him short. &ldquo;It was my duty, too. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>But
for Felizardo, I do not suppose I should be here now. They would have
killed me that day we hanged Juan Vagas, and&mdash;and there were other
things as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right. It does not follow that because you
seem indiscreet you are wrong,&rdquo; Father Doyle answered, speaking
slowly. &ldquo;They say, too, that I was indiscreet&mdash;and
unpatriotic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other looked up quickly. &ldquo;Who says so? The
Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Doyle shook his head. &ldquo;No&mdash;the Church understands,
of course. But Commissioner Gumpertz says I was wrong,&rdquo; and he
smiled, possibly because he was thinking that the censure of the Head
of the Department of Lands and Registration was but a small matter when
one had the approval of the Church, as Mr Gumpertz himself presently
found to his cost, when, on his own authority, he made a statement to
the Press that the Commission would take steps against Father
Doyle.</p>
<p>The following afternoon Basil called on Commissioner Furber,
expecting a stormy interview, but found himself mistaken. The
Commissioner was cold and severely official in manner, though, as the
visitor was quick to note, there was none of that personal hostility
which had marked their former meetings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent for you at the request of the Commission,&rdquo; Mr
Furber said. &ldquo;This is not a departmental matter, or, rather, they
will not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>have it treated as one. Therefore, I can say
nothing about it yet. Possibly, they may call you before them, or they
may communicate with you by letter at your hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil got up to take his leave, but, as he reached the door, the
Commissioner called him back. &ldquo;Captain Hayle,&rdquo; he said a
little haltingly. &ldquo;We have not agreed too well in the past; and I
will admit that in some things I have been wrong, or unjust. But this
is not my doing. I, also, have met Felizardo, and&mdash;and I
understand why you went to San Polycarpio that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the end, they did not summon Basil before the Commission, for
what seemed to them a good and sufficient reason. Clancy of the
<i>Star</i> had cabled the story of the funeral at San Polycarpio to a
certain great newspaper in New York, and the editor of that paper had
decided forthwith to make Captain Hayle the hero of the hour.
Consequently, as even Commissioner Gumpertz had to acknowledge, it
would have been a most injudicious thing to take any steps against the
Constabulary officer; in fact, before the matter had come up again for
discussion, there had arrived peremptory cables from Washington
ordering them to leave Basil Hayle alone, not because Washington
admired the conduct of the latter, but because, as ever,
Washington&rsquo;s main consideration was the question of the votes it
might lose at the next election. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>Still, Basil was not allowed to go scot-free. The Governor-General
and Commissioner Gumpertz saw to that; the former because he was galled
at the interference from Washington; the latter because it was Captain
Hayle who had rescued Mr Joseph Gobbitt, and so allowed possible buyers
to know that there were head-hunters living on that most desirable
tract of hemp land to the north of Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains. Had Mr
Gobbitt&rsquo;s head been permitted to hang from the ridge pole of a
shack, beside that of Albert Dunk, no one in Manila would have known
his fate, and the succession of would-be purchasers, willing to deposit
five or six thousand dollars each, might have remained unbroken,
greatly to the profit both of himself and of the head-hunters.</p>
<p>The result of the feeling against Basil was that he could not obtain
permission to return to his post. Day after day went by, and still he
was detained on futile excuses, until he began to realise that they did
not intend him to go back to duty at Calocan. Moreover, there had been
no further word out of Igut, either from Mrs Bush or from Don Juan, and
the silence was driving him mad. At last, in sheer despair, he called
on Commissioner Furber. That official looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know why they dropped all idea of open
proceedings against you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Well, it is because
they have made a hero of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href=
"#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>you in the States,&rdquo; and the
flicker of a smile crossed his face. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have been
wise, you see. As regards the future, I may as well tell you plainly.
You are a marked man, and your chances in the Service are <i>nil</i>. I
have done what I can for you, because I believe I owe you some
reparation; but I must not strain things too far; in the end, that
would benefit neither of us. I may tell you that if you remain in the
Service you will be sent to one of the outlying islands, and that, I
believe&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke <span class="corr" id="xd25e2797" title=
"Source: meaningly">meaningfully</span>&mdash;&ldquo;would not suit
you. Moreover, one is apt to meet with accidents in those places, as
perhaps one of my colleagues, Mr Gumpertz, could tell you. Speaking
unofficially&mdash;in fact you must regard all this as
unofficial&mdash;I should advise you to resign. It would be
wiser&mdash;and safer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil drummed on the table with his fingers. At last,
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I think you are right. Can I
do it now? I suppose it will be to you that I hand my
resignation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Captain Hayle resigned, and his resignation was accepted
immediately, and then he went back with his successor to hand over the
Government property in his charge, and to bid farewell to his plucky
little men, who had fought under him on Felizardo&rsquo;s mountain,
followed him in the forced march over the pass, carried out the great
killing in the plaza at Igut, and stood firm when the mob at Calocan
threatened to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>rescue Juan Vagas from the gallows. He had to do
those two things, and after doing them he would be a free man again,
free to go to Igut if he wished, or rather if he thought it wise so to
do, for his wish was always to be there.</p>
<p>It was not an easy thing to say good-bye to his men, after all. Like
so many of their kind, they had come to regard themselves as being in
his personal service; the State was a thing of which they knew nothing,
towards which they felt no kind of loyalty; consequently, his departure
filled them with absolute consternation; and though his successor was
as lax and easy-going as the most tired Filipino could wish an officer
to be, half his company was missing before the end of a fortnight,
greatly to his disgust. But when he reported the fact to Commissioner
Furber, the latter took it very quietly. &ldquo;They were Hayle&rsquo;s
men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And, from the first, I was doubtful whether
they would stay with any one else. He was a man of rather an uncommon
type;&rdquo; then, as if thinking he had said too much, he went on
curtly. &ldquo;Let them go. Don&rsquo;t worry to fetch them back, so
long as they&rsquo;ve taken no carbines. I will send you some recruits
to take their places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil Hayle did not actually break down after he had bidden farewell
to his men, but he went so near to it that he would not trust
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>himself to accept his successor&rsquo;s offer,
and stay the night in the barracks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got through with it
now, and it will only reopen the sore if I stay here. I will go across
to Father Doyle&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new officer, who had never got down to crude things, such as the
fight on Felizardo&rsquo;s mountain, or the march over the pass, looked
at him in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought you would have been glad enough to be
clear of the outfit. I know if I could afford to resign I should go
to-morrow. There&rsquo;s not much pleasure or glory in commanding a
company of savages, who will probably bolt at the first shot and leave
you to be boloed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil shrugged his shoulders, and then crossed the plaza to Father
Doyle&rsquo;s house, where he took off his uniform for the last time,
presently coming down in civilian clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over now,&rdquo; he said briefly, as he selected a
cigar from his host&rsquo;s box.</p>
<p>Father Doyle nodded. &ldquo;When I first met you I knew it must come
to this before long. There was never room for you in the Service. What
are you going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil stared out across the bay towards Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains.
&ldquo;I am not quite sure yet,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;But I
think&mdash;I think I shall go to Igut first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest had been expecting that answer, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>and
had given much thought to the question of how Basil&rsquo;s going was
to be prevented. He had conceived several good schemes for delaying
him; but now that it had come to the point, none of them seemed likely
to be of the slightest avail. It was not an easy matter in which to
interfere, especially as Basil, though perhaps his closest friend, was
not one of his flock. So finally he said nothing about it, trusting
that by the morning something might occur to make his intervention
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see Felizardo again,&rdquo; Basil went on:
&ldquo;It is curious how he and I have come into one another&rsquo;s
lives,&rdquo; and then, suddenly, he began to tell the other man the
whole story, beginning with the fight on the slope of the volcano, when
he surprised the outpost and captured Felizardo&rsquo;s daughter, and
carrying it down to the time when Father Doyle himself came into it;
only, he omitted all mention of Mrs Bush, though he did not gloss over
the ways of Bush himself; and both what he left out, and what he said,
made the priest more than ever anxious to stop him from going to
Igut.</p>
<p>The sun was just setting when he finished, and a dozen or so tao
passed the house on their way up from the beach; then, following them,
came two strange natives, one of whom was carrying a heavy basket. A
moment later, &ldquo;They are coming here. They look <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>as
if they wanted you, Hayle,&rdquo; the priest said.</p>
<p>They came on to the veranda of the house, took off their hats, then
the elder of them presented a letter to Basil. &ldquo;From the Senor
Felizardo,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Basil opened it, wondering; then, as he read, the wonder changed to
utter astonishment, for it ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Senor Felizardo sends his compliments to
the Captain of the Constabulary, who, as he hears, will no longer be
his foe in the field, but can now be his friend in all things. That is
good. But he hears with grief that the Captain will be leaving the
Islands; and that is bad. Therefore, Felizardo hastens to pay his
debts. Once, many months ago, the Captain returned to him his daughter,
whom, next to his wife, he loved best of all things in this world; and
Felizardo promised then to repay the good deed. Now he sends, in this
basket, the thing the Captain most desires to have.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Captain Hayle handed the note to the priest, then he turned to the
messengers. &ldquo;Open the basket,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But they shook their heads. &ldquo;Not here on the balcony, where
the tao can see. It should be taken inside the house, Senor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They set it on a table, and then they withdrew, whilst Basil was
undoing the cords, which held down the lid. First he came on a layer of
leaves, which he threw on the floor, then he raised a white linen
cloth, and sprang back with a cry of horror; for there, livid and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>ghastly, was the head of John Bush, late of the
Philippine Scouts. A few minutes later, when he went to look for the
messengers, they were gone, although he could see a canoe with two men
in it being paddled in leisurely fashion across the bay.</p>
<p>Basil took the ghastly trophy to an outhouse, thinking as he went,
&ldquo;The head-hunters would treasure this,&rdquo; for there was not a
spark of pity in his mind, even though he had yet to hear of those two
blows which Mrs Bush had received on the mouth; then he went back to
the veranda where Father Doyle was waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It served him right,&rdquo; he said curtly; and, after a
pause, he added: &ldquo;I was going to kill him myself. Felizardo says
the only law that counts is the Law of the Bolo, and he is
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Doyle did not reply, having no answer ready, and knowing, in
his own heart, that what had happened was for the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go to Igut,&rdquo; Basil spoke suddenly; and now the
priest nodded in approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you should go first thing in the morning. She will need
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that was not Basil&rsquo;s meaning. &ldquo;I shall go
to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And if the tao will not take me across
in a canoe some of my men&mdash;some of my old company, I
mean&mdash;will do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tao refused, fearing the dark, and not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>loving him on account of the hanging of Juan
Vagas; but when, after obtaining the permission of his successor, he
asked for four men to paddle and one to steer, every member of the
company stepped forward to volunteer. He selected the old serjeant, and
four of those who had been with him on the mountain-side when
Felizardo&rsquo;s bolomen killed three quarters of his force; and they
started out through the night to paddle to Igut.</p>
<p>After a while, he turned to the serjeant, who was steering.
&ldquo;The Captain of the Scouts at Igut has been killed,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The serjeant nodded. &ldquo;I know, Senor. I heard the news an hour
ago. I was expecting it,&rdquo; he added calmly.</p>
<p>Basil looked at him in astonishment. &ldquo;You were expecting it?
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man smiled <span class="corr" id="xd25e2878" title=
"Source: meaningly">meaningfully</span>. &ldquo;Just after they buried
the wife of Felizardo, over there in San Polycarpio, Captain Bush
struck his wife twice on the mouth. They were on the balcony, and down
in the plaza, sitting in the shadow of the belfry, were three of
Felizardo&rsquo;s men, who saw it all. Hearing that, and knowing how
Felizardo had loved his own wife, Dolores&mdash;did he not take to the
hills for her sake?&mdash;I knew that Captain Bush must die by the
bolo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Basil clenched his hands. So he had struck her, in the sight of
natives, too! And she had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=
"#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>never given him a hint of it, nor
had Don Juan Ramirez. Then, very reverently, he thanked God that he had
not known; for, had he heard of it before, he would assuredly have shot
Captain Bush like a dog; and that, as he realised now, would have made
matters infinitely worse.</p>
<p>The night seemed very beautiful as they paddled across the bay. Just
before they came to the entrance of Igut harbour, the moon rose from
behind Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains, and Basil found himself wondering
how he could ever have regarded the range as a place of horror and
death, in which you set foot at the risk of your life. Surely all that
must have been an evil dream.</p>
<p>Igut was asleep when he landed there, and no light was showing in
Mrs Bush&rsquo;s house; but old Don Juan was still sitting up. &ldquo;I
thought you might come,&rdquo; the Spaniard said. &ldquo;Two men, who
landed a couple of hours ago, said they had seen you, and you had heard
the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Basil wanted to hear one thing first. &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say she is better now, although the shock was great. It
was I who had to break the news to her&#8202;&hellip;. They killed him
down at the lower end of the town, outside the mestizo&rsquo;s house.
We suppose it was the head-hunters, for we never found the
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the head, at Calocan,&rdquo; Basil said and told him
of Felizardo&rsquo;s letter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href=
"#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>Before they went to bed that night, they had arranged the matter.
Amongst white men, Basil and Father Doyle and Don Juan Ramirez alone
knew the truth, and there was no reason why any one else, save perhaps
Mrs Bush, need know. So, officially, Captain Bush met his end at the
hands of a stray party of head-hunters whilst going his rounds; and
they granted a pension to the widow, which, afterwards, she refused to
take.</p>
<p>Mrs Bush rose with a cry of glad surprise when they told her Basil
was downstairs; and she hurried into the room with hands outstretched.
&ldquo;Oh! I was praying you would come when you heard of it,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I should have gone mad with no one to speak
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent down and kissed her hands. &ldquo;My Lady,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>And then they understood one another at last, because the bar to
their understanding, that which would have made it a sin before, had
been removed, in accordance with the Law of the Bolo. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h2 class="main">HOW FELIZARDO MADE PEACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was six months after Mrs Bush had become Mrs Basil
Hayle that a new Governor-General arrived in Manila. Much had happened
since the day when the High Gods at Washington had ordered the
Commission not to prosecute Captain Hayle for the part he had taken in
the funeral at San Polycarpio. There had been scandals and rumours of
scandals, especially in connection with that contract for a road to the
hills which had been granted to the nominees of Commissioners Gumpertz
and Johnson; and though no less than three editors had been sentenced
to long terms of imprisonment, apparently for having discovered the
truth, the stories had quickly found their way to the United States,
where it is not so easy to arrange for the sentence on a journalist
before you even issue the warrant for his arrest. Moreover, not only
was the annual deficit in the revenue increasing, but fresh
insurrections had broken out in two of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>southern islands, whilst the sedition amongst
the mestizos in Manila was now apparent to all men.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Washington came to the conclusion that a change
was imperative, unless votes were to be lost in the States at the next
election; so the old Governor-General went home, rich in dollars if not
in honour; and a new Governor-General, who thought little of dollars
and much of honour, came out to take his place, greatly to the
satisfaction of the non-official white population, and greatly to the
grief of Commissioner Gumpertz, who had not yet succeeded in selling
that hemp land on the northern side of Felizardo&rsquo;s mountains. In
fact, so deeply was he pained, so apprehensive of the way in which true
patriots would be treated under the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, that he
sent a very strong remonstrance to the Party managers, who,
sympathising with him, found him a post as one of the auditors of the
National Finance, an appointment for which his gifts and previous
training rendered him admirably suited.</p>
<p>Chief Collector Sharler also left the Custom House at the same time,
having come into a large property from his father. Incidentally, he
obtained a divorce from his mestiza wife, not because he had changed
his opinions on the subject of Racial Equality, but because he had
changed his opinion concerning her, and did not want to take her and
her relations back with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>him to the United States. Mrs
Sharler herself acquiesced in the arrangement readily, having another
husband in view, so all was for the best. Unlike his predecessor, the
new Chief-Collector had no theories or obsessions; only, he had a
predilection in favour of men of his own colour; consequently, all the
mestizo assistant collectors retired into private life and became
converts to the insurrecto policy; whilst, as was but right, the spoils
of office went to certain faithful, if somewhat obscure, persons, who
had served the party well in the States. Yet, though such a great
clearance was made, the importers remained dissatisfied, and that ugly
word &ldquo;graft&rdquo; continued to be amongst those most frequently
on their lips&mdash;which goes to show that some people are confirmed
grumblers.</p>
<p>Commissioner Furber, on the other hand, retained his office rather
to the regret of the new Governor-General, who did not like him
personally; but, though the Commissioner was fully aware of this
feeling, the fact did not weigh with him in the least degree. There
were certain things he had determined to do before he quitted office;
and, with the obstinacy of a narrow-minded man, he did not intend to be
turned from his purpose.</p>
<p>One of these things was the settlement of the Felizardo question. If
any one else had proved, or attempted to prove, to him that his first
policy had been wrong, Mr Furber would <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>probably have set his
face and continued on the same lines, or would have declined to have
anything more to do with the matter. As it was, however, it was he
himself who had made the discovery of his own mistakes, and he was
sincerely anxious to set these right; consequently, as soon as the new
Governor-General had settled down to his work, Commissioner Furber laid
the whole question before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had no fighting now for nearly a year,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and I see no reason why there should be any more. We
wasted a great deal of money and a good many lives over it, without
injuring Felizardo in the least&mdash;in fact he gained both recruits
and rifles&mdash;and I am anxious it should not happen
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor-General looked at him keenly. &ldquo;I have been going
into the matter, and I find that it was you yourself who advised these
expeditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he expected excuses from the Commissioner, he was mistaken in his
man. &ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; Mr Furber answered curtly. &ldquo;It was
my doing. I was entirely wrong in my policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man regarded him with a degree of respect he had never
shown before. &ldquo;I see. And what do you propose to do now? What do
you wish me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to make a formal peace with Felizardo. He is an old
man, and he is averse to any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href=
"#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>further trouble. If we arrange
matters now, during his lifetime, the band will break up in the natural
course of events, as soon as its military character has gone; but so
long as we let the present state of affairs continue, keeping them
always on the defensive, they must be a danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would go out to the mountains and treat with these
people?&rdquo; the Governor-General asked.</p>
<p>The answer came promptly. &ldquo;I would, if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor shook his head. &ldquo;It would be dangerous,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The Commissioner flushed. &ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; he answered
coldly.</p>
<p>The other hastened to explain. &ldquo;I was thinking of the
possibility of his holding you as a hostage, and demanding all sorts of
concessions. No, Commissioner,&rdquo; he spoke decisively, &ldquo;I
will not consent to that, though I appreciate your offer. Is there any
one else you can suggest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Captain Hayle. He knows Felizardo well, and would go
willingly. We can trust to his discretion.&rdquo; Mr Furber&rsquo;s
opinion of Basil had changed considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; the Governor asked. &ldquo;In the
States?&rdquo; He looked dubious. &ldquo;That means a great deal of
expense. Would no one else do?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be cheaper than another expedition,&rdquo; the
Commissioner retorted.</p>
<p>And so, that very day, the Philippine Commission sent a long cable
to the ex-officer of Constabulary whom it had once forced to resign his
commission because he had gone to the funeral of Dolores, the wife of
Felizardo, asking him to return and arrange terms of peace with the
outlaws in the mountains.</p>
<p>As soon as Basil had read the cable he went in search of his wife.
&ldquo;Shall I go, dearest?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She smiled as she saw the eager look on his face.
&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Shall we go?&rsquo; you mean. Of course. I think
we owe something to Felizardo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next mail steamer took them to Manila, where Basil had a long
interview with the Governor-General and Commissioner Furber; and then
he and his wife went by launch to Katubig, avoiding Igut because of its
evil memories.</p>
<p>They found Katubig rebuilt, and found also the same old Teniente who
had once sent the Constabulary off on a futile errand. Now, however, he
received Basil as if no such event had ever occurred; and when he heard
of what the business in hand was, he promised to send word to the old
chief, with the result that, on the second morning, Felizardo himself
came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; the outlaw said. &ldquo;There have been
many letters between the Commissioner <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>and myself; but I
said always that it must be you who came to arrange matters, because of
the respect there is between us. So he promised,&rdquo; which was news
to Basil, and would have been news to the Governor-General.</p>
<p>It did not take them long to come to terms, each side being ready
for a lasting peace. Practically, it came to a general amnesty for the
whole band, and an undertaking on both sides to cease from all acts of
hostility, though, as Felizardo said concerning the latter clause,
&ldquo;I could fight no more now, because, once the whole country is
open to them, all my young men will go. It is dull work on the
mountains to-day, with no fighting, no outpost duty; and there are few
young women amongst us. There will remain only the old men, who, like
myself, are waiting for death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They offered to give him the title of Governor of the mountains, but
he shook his head. &ldquo;What difference would it make? I shall be the
Chief still until I die. Then they can make a Governor if they wish
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the question of laws, he would not give way, as Basil had
foreseen. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Law of the Bolo has
served here for many years; and that, too, can remain in force till I
die. After all, what do we, old men, want with laws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they signed the treaty, which, unlike most of its kind, was
destined to be kept; and then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271"
href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>it came to a question of
bidding farewell, which, for Basil at least, was very hard&mdash;harder
even than when he had parted from his men at Calocan, for he knew he
would never see Felizardo again. They shook hands in silence, with the
grip of strong men, and Felizardo kissed the hand of Mrs Hayle. Then he
turned once again to Basil, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May she always be as dear to you, Senor, as Dolores Lasara,
for whose sake I took to the hills, and whom I hope to rejoin very
soon, was to me.&rdquo; And after that they saw Felizardo no more.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
